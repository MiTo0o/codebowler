SHREK: (Reading a storybook) Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (Laughs, tears out a page of the book) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush).

"Allstar" by Smash Mouth begins to play. Shrek exits an outhouse and goes about his day in the swamp.

In a nearby village, an angry mob gather up to go after Shrek. At night, the villagers head into the swamp and wait outside Shrek's home.

NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

Villager 1: Think it's in there?

Villager 2: All right. Let's get it!

Villager 1: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

Villager 3: Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.

Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

SHREK: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin...

Villagers: No!

SHREK: They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.

Villager 1: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (Waves the torch at Shrek.)

Shrek licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The men shrink back away from him. Shrek terrifies the mob with a frightening roar, his spit extinguishing all the remaining torches.

SHREK: (Whispering) This is the part where you run away.

The men drop their torches and pitchforks and flee as fast they can.

SHREK: And stay out! (looks down and picks up a wanted poster. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairytale creatures." (He sighs and drops the paper on the ground.)

THE NEXT DAY - FOREST

Lines of fairy tale creatures are put in chains and are led into wagons by Duloc Guards. The Captain of the Duloc Guards sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairytale creatures in. Waiting in line is Donkey on a leash and his owner. Some of the others in line include Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Geppetto who is carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer carrying the Three Little Pigs.

GUARD: All right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!

THE CAPTAIN: Next!

GUARD: (Taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half)

THE CAPTAIN: That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!

GUARD: Get up! Come on!

Mama Bear and Papa Bear are locked inside giant cages, with Little Bear in his own cage.

LITTLE BEAR: (crying) This cage is too small.

DONKEY: (To his owner) Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!

OLD WOMAN: Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

DONKEY: Oh!

THE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?

GEPPETTO: This little wooden puppet.

PINOCCHIO: I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows)

THE CAPTAIN: Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.

PINOCCHIO: Father, please! Don't let them do this! Help me! (Geppetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up to the table.)

THE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?

OLD WOMAN: Well, I've got a talking donkey.

THE CAPTAIN: Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.

OLD WOMAN: Oh, go ahead, little fella. (Donkey stays silent).

THE CAPTAIN: Well?..

OLD WOMAN: Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. (Smacks Donkey) Talk, you boneheaded dolt, talk!

THE CAPTAIN: That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!

OLD WOMAN: No, no, he talks! He does. (Moving Donkey's lips) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw.

THE CAPTAIN: Get her out of my sight.

OLD WOMAN: No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled with fairy dust and starts floating upwards.

DONKEY: Hey! I can fly!

PETER PAN: He can fly!

THREE LITTLE PIGS: He can fly!

THE CAPTAIN: He can talk?!

DONKEY: Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (The pixie dust's effects begin to wear off) Uh-oh. (He drops out of the air and hits the ground with a thud.)

THE CAPTAIN: Seize him!

Donkey dodges the guards as they try to grab him and runs deeper into the forest.

GUARDS: He's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!

Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs head first into Shrek's backside. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him and glares down at Donkey. Donkey looks scared of Shrek for a moment, but he quickly hides him after seeing that the guards have caught up to him.

THE CAPTAIN: You there. Ogre!

SHREK: Aye?

THE CAPTAIN: By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am authorized to place you both under arrest and...(Shrek slowly approaches the group of guards, the guards visibly frightened by him) transport you to... a designated...resettlement...facility?

SHREK: Oh, really? You and what army? (Smiles)

The Captain looks behind himself and sees that all the other guards have abandoned him. The Captain tucks tail and runs off. Shrek shakes his head and starts walking back to his swamp. Donkey, impressed by Shrek, follows him.

DONKEY: Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!

SHREK: Are you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa!

DONKEY: Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back there? Man those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.

SHREK: (Annoyed) Oh, that's great. Really.

DONKEY: Man, it's good to be free.

SHREK: Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?

DONKEY: But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.

Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before loudly roaring in is face.

DONKEY: Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day.

SHREK: Why are you following me?

DONKEY: I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have friends...

SHREK: Stop singing! (Picks up Donkey by his ears and tail) It's no wonder you don't have any friends (drops him).

DONKEY: Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.

SHREK: Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?

DONKEY: (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh...really tall?

SHREK: No! I'm an ogre! You know, "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you?

DONKEY: Nope.

SHREK: Really?

DONKEY: Really, really.

SHREK: Oh.

DONKEY: Man, I like you. What's you name?

SHREK: Uh, Shrek.

DONKEY: Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of "I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me" thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill overlooking Shrek's home.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that?

SHREK: That would be my home.

DONKEY: Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. (Looks at Shrek's "keep out" signs) I guess you don't entertain much, do you?

SHREK: I like my privacy.

DONKEY: You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You'retrying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. And there's that big awkward silence you know? (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?

SHREK: Uh, what?

DONKEY: Can I stay with you, please?

SHREK: (sarcastically) Of course!

DONKEY: Really?

SHREK: No.

DONKEY: Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (Donkey pushes Shrek up against the door) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!

SHREK: Okay! Okay! But one night only.

DONKEY: Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the hut)

SHREK: What are you...No! (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No!

DONKEY: This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin'... I'm makin' waffles.

SHREK: Oh!

DONKEY: Where do, uh, I sleep?

SHREK: (irritated) Outside!

DONKEY: Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door, shutting Donkey outside) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...

SHREK'S HOME - NIGHT

Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits down and lights a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a noise. He stands up with a huff.

SHREK: (to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside!

DONKEY: (from the window) I am outside!

Shrek hears a noise from inside and turns to find the source. He sees several shadows moving and looks around, spotting the Three Blind Mice on his table.

MOUSE 1: Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have?

MOUSE 2: It's not home, but it'll do just fine.

GORDON: (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.

SHREK Got ya. (Grabs Gordon, but he escapes and lands on his shoulder.)

GORDON: I found some cheese. (bites into Shrek's ear)

SHREK: Ow! (tries to grab him)

GORDO: Blah! Awful stuff. (jumps down to the table)

BLIND MOUSE: Is that you, Gordon?

GORDO: How did you know?

SHREK: Enough! (he grabs all three mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey!

Shrek turns around and sees the Seven Dwarves have put Snow White, sleeping in her glass coffin, on the table.

SHREK: Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table!

DWARF: Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.

SHREK: Huh?

Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at him.

BIG BAD WOLF: What?

Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging him to the front door.

SHREK: I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy?

He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that a horde of fairytale creatures have set up camp in his swamp.

SHREK: Oh, no. No! No! (He dodges out the way of a group of witches flying on broomsticks)

The Three Bears (minus Mama Bear) sit around the fire, the Pied Piper is playing his pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.

SHREK: What are you doing in my swamp?!! (this echoes throughout the camp and everyone falls silent.)

Gasps are heard all around. The Three Good Fairies hide inside a tent.

SHREK: All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there! Not there! (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey)

DONKEY: Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

PINOCCHIO: Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

SHREK: What?

PINOCCHIO: We were forced to come here.

SHREK: (flabbergasted) By who?

LITTLE PIG: Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice.

SHREK: (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this... "Farquaad" guy is?

Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.

DONKEY: Oh, I do. I know where he is!

SHREK: Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?

DONKEY: Me! Me!

SHREK: Anyone?

DONKEY: Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!

SHREK: (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention all...fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd cheers wildly.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me.

DONKEY: All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it!

DONKEY: (singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again.

SHREK: What did I say about singing?

DONKEY: Can I whistle?

SHREK: No.

DONKEY: Can I hum it?

SHREK: All right, hum it.

Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.

DULOC - DUNGEON

A masked man is pouring a glass of milk. Another man is shown walking down the hallway towards the room. As he is let into the room by two guards, we can see that the man is abnormally short. The masked man is dunking a small person into the glass of milk.

FARQUAAD: (stepping forward) That's enough. He's ready to talk.

The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk by Thelonious and is slammed down onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad manically laughs as he walks over to the table. When he reaches the table we see that it only goes up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.

FARQUAAD: (he picks up the Gingy's severed legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man!

GINGY: You're a monster.

FARQUAAD: I'm not the monster here, you are. (throws one leg at Gingy) You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world (crumbes his other leg into dust). Now, tell me! Where are the others?!

GINGY: Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.)

FARQUAAD: I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he grabs one of Gingy's gumdrop buttons)

GINGY: No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons!

FARQUAAD: All right then. Who's hiding them?

GINGY: Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?

FARQUAAD: The muffin man?

GINGERBREAD MAN: The muffin man.

FARQUAAD: Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?

GINGERBREAD MAN: Well, she's married to the muffin man.

FARQUAAD: The muffin man?

GINGERBREAD MAN: The muffin man!

FARQUAAD: She's married to the muffin man...(A door opens and the Captain announces himself)

HEAD GUARD: My lord! We've found it.

FARQUAAD: Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in!

More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic Mirror.

GINGERBREAD MAN: (in awe) Ohhhh...

FARQUAAD: Magic mirror...

GINGERBREAD MAN: Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No!

FARQUAAD: Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall, is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?

MIRROR: Well, technically you're not a king.

FARQUAAD: Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying?

MIRROR: What I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess.

FARQUAAD: Go on.

MIRROR: (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are!

Using himself as a screen, the Magic Mirror presents a dating show to Farquaad, Thelonious, the Captain, and a few Duloc Guards.

MIRROR: Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes piña coladas and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be: bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three?

GUARDS: Two! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three!

FARQUAAD: Three? One? Three?

THELONIUS: Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord!

FARQUAAD: Okay, okay, uh, number three!

MIRROR: Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.

"Escape (The Piña Colada Song)" by Rupert Holmes begins playing. The crowd cheers.

FARQUAAD: (Gazing at her portrait) Princess Fiona...she's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go...(Farquaad starts braintstorming)

MIRROR: But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.

FARQUAAD: (Talking to himself, ignoring the Mirror) I'll do it.

MIRROR: Yes, but after sunset...

FARQUAAD: Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and Duloc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)

DULOC KINGDOM - EXTERIOR

Shrek and Donkey come out of the field just outside the Duloc parking lot.

DONKEY: But that's it. That's it right there. That's Duloc. I told ya I'd find it.

SHREK: (Gazing up at Duloc Castle, a building that towers over the rest of the kingdom) So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.

DONKEY: Uh-huh. That's the place.

SHREK: Do you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.)

DONKEY: Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

MAN: Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.! (The man and his wife hurry into the entrance)

SHREK: Hey, you! (

A mascot, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.

SHREK: Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just- - I just - -

Shrek sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The mascot runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into Duloc.)

DULOC - INTERIOR

They look around but all is quiet and there is not a person in sight

SHREK: It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?

DONKEY: Hey, look at this!

Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin to sing.

WOODEN PEOPLE: Welcome to Duloc such a perfect town / Here we have some rules let us lay them down / Don't make waves, stay in line and we'll get along fine / Duloc is perfect place / Please keep off of the grass / Shine your shoes, wipe your... face / Duloc is, Duloc is / Duloc is perfect place.

Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture, both of which are dumbfounded.

DONKEY: Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again)

SHREK: (grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.

They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.

FARQUAAD: Brave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...

As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena Donkey is humming the Duloc theme song.

SHREK: All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.

DONKEY: Sorry about that.

COURTYARD

In the center of a stadium-like courtyard, Duloc Knights are gathered as a large crowd of citizens watches on from the stands. Horses, kegs of beer, arrow targets, and other equipment are scattered about. Farquaad is atop a high up balcony, flanked by two guards, addressing the crowd. Shrek and Donkey step out onto the courtyard but don't seem to be noticed.

FARQUAAD: That champion shall have the honor-- no, no -- the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin!

Shrek marches through the Duloc Knights, who back away in disgust upon noticing him.

FARQUAAD: (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? (The crowd gasps) It's hideous!

SHREK: (Looks at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey (Donkey looks confused, the joke is once again lost on him).

FARQUAAD: Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! (Points at Shrek)

The Duloc Knights draw their weapons and slowly approach Shrek as he backs up, the crowd cheering them on.

CROWD: Get him!

SHREK: Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer)

CROWD: Go ahead! Get him!

SHREK: (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint?

CROWD: Kill the beast!

SHREK: No? All right then. (drinks the ale in one gulp) Come on!

Shrek takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out, knocking the knights down and wetting the ground into mud. Shrek slides past the knights and uses a spear like a hockey stick to knock one of his feet. Donkey hops up onto one of the larger beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. Donkey manages to squish two knights into the mud and rolls over another group of knights running after Shrek. Shrek uses the ropes of the wrestling ring to launch himself at two knights and knocks them over. The crowd Shrek jump kicks a knight, and then body slams another. A knight comes from behind Shrek with his spear ready to attack. The crowd gasps, but before he can make a move Shrek puts him in a full-nelson hold.

DONKEY: Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

Shrek brings the knight over to Donkey, who leans on the ropes and headbutts the knight. Shrek gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd, who have now begun to cheer for Shrek and Donkey.

SHREK: Yeah!

A knight tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but he turns in time to sees him and jumps on him.

WOMAN: The chair! Give him the chair!

Shrek uses a folding chair to smack the knight lying on the ground. Shrek dispatches a few more knights with ease. Shrek picks up the last knight, spinning him over his head and then throwing him into the wrestling ring. Donkey kicks his helmet, and the ding sounds the end of the match. Finally all the knights are down. The audience goes wild.

SHREK: Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)

Farquaad motions to the guards, who then aim their crossbows at Shrek and Donkey. The crowd gasps and goes silent. Shrek stops laughing.

GUARD: Shall I give the order, sir?

FARQUAAD: No, I have a better idea. People of Duloc, I give you our champion!

The crowd cheers and a fanfare plays.

SHREK: What?

FARQUAAD: Congratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.

SHREK: Quest? I'm already on a quest. A quest to get my swamp back.

FARQUAAD: Your swamp?

SHREK: Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures!

FARQUAAD: Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back.

SHREK: Exactly the way it was?

FARQUAAD: Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.

SHREK: And the squatters?

FARQUAAD: As good as gone.

SHREK: What kind of quest?

DULOC - EXTERIOR

Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the fields heading away from Duloc. Shrek is munching on an onion.

DONKEY: Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right?

SHREK: You know, maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

DONKEY: I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip.

SHREK: Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?

DONKEY: Uh, no, not really, no.

SHREK: For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.

DONKEY: Example?

SHREK: Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. (he holds out his onion)

DONKEY: (sniffs the onion) They stink?

SHREK: Yes - - No!

DONKEY: They make you cry?

SHREK: No!

DONKEY: Oh, you leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.

SHREK: No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. (he throws away the onion and walks off)

DONKEY: (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.

SHREK: I don't care... what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes.

DONKEY: You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfait"? Parfaits are delicious.

SHREK: (Yelling) No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! End of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.

DONKEY: Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.

SHREK: You know, I think I preferred your humming.

DONKEY: Do you have a tissue or something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait makes me start slobbering.

They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek burns his foot trying to stomp out the campfire, so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out. They arrive at the outskirts of a giant, ominous volcano.

DONKEY: (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open and everything.

SHREK: Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We must be getting close.

DONKEY: Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone neither.

They climb up the side of the volcano.

DRAGON'S KEEP - EXTERIOR

They reach the top of the volcano and gaze out into the crater. An immense, dilapidated castle sits upon a large rock surround by boiling lava in the center of the crater. The only way forward is over a precarious wooden bridge. A single light can be seen in the window of the tallest tower. Thunder strikes and crows circling the castle can be heard. Its all very ominous.

SHREK: Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. (laughs)

DONKEY: (chuckes along nervously) Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said that ogres have layers?

SHREK: Oh, aye.

DONKEY: Well, I have a bit of a confession to make (Gasps, seeing the skeleton of a horse). Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.

SHREK: Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.

DONKEY: You know what I mean.

SHREK: Oh you can't tell me you're afraid of heights.

DONKEY: No, I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava!

SHREK: Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support. We'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time. DONKEY: Really?

SHREK: Really, really.

DONKEY: Okay, that makes me feel so much better.

SHREK: Just keep moving. And don't look down.

DONKEY: (Nervously to himself) Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down. (he steps through a rotting board and ends up looking straight down into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please!

SHREK: But you're already halfway.

DONKEY: But I know that half is safe!

SHREK: Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

DONKEY: Shrek, no! Wait!

SHREK: Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me? (bounces and sways the bridge)

DONKEY: Don't do that!

SHREK: Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces the bridge again)

DONKEY: Yes, that!

SHREK: Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across the bridge)

DONKEY: No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

SHREK: You said do it! I'm doin' it.

DONKEY: I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) Oh!

SHREK: That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks towards the castle)

DONKEY: Cool. So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

SHREK: Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. (chuckles)

DONKEY: I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

DRAGON'S KEEP - INTERIOR

Shrek and Donkey wander through the halls of the castle in search of the princess. The castle is in ruins and not a sound can be heard.

DONKEY: You afraid?

SHREK: No. But...Shh. (Shushes Donkey)

DONKEY: Oh, good. Me neither. (Get spooked and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire. It sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.

Donkey crashes into a pile of knight remains, knocking over a skeleton whose helmet lands on Donkey's head. The skeleton head falls off and Donkey gasps.

SHREK: Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs (Grabs the helmet and puts it on).

DONKEY: Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.

SHREK: (Picking up pieces of armor) The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.

DONKEY: What makes you think she'll be there?

SHREK: I read it in a book once. (walks off)

DONKEY: Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'.

Donkey wanders off into another room, still talking to himself as he looks around.

DONKEY: I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it.

Behind a broken wall, a giant eye opens to see an unaware Donkey. Elsewhere, Shrek spots a light in the window of a tower.

SHREK: Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the...

DONKEY: Dragon!

Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars and breathes fire. The dragon chases after Donkey, stomping on the pile of knight remains in its way.

SHREK: Donkey, look out!

Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon breathes fire. The dragon is just about to eat Donkey when Shrek grabs agold of its tail.

SHREK: Got ya!

The dragon begins to swing it's tail back and forth with Shrek still holding on, then launces him into the air. Shrek crashes through the roof of the tallest tower and into Fiona's room. Fiona wakes up and looks at him lying on the floor unconscious.

DONKEY: Oh! Aah! Aah!

The dragon now focuses its attention on Donkey, breathing fire at him and forcing him onto a stone bridge. The dragon knocks down portions of the bridge until Donkey is left staying on a lone pillar.

DONKEY: No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon growls) Oh, what large teeth you have. (the dragon roars) I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness?

The dragon appears to be flattered by Donkey's compliments.

DONKEY: And you know what else? You're-- You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes at him) What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye?

Dragon blows a heart-shaped smoke ring at Donkey.

DONKEY: Ohh. Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh...(coughs) I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings and stuff. Shrek! (She picks him up with her teeth and happily carries him off) No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

FIONA'S TOWER - INTERIOR

Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor, his back to the princess. Fiona, ecstatic to see her knight-in-shining armor, straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off the side table. She lays back down and pretends to be asleep. Shrek turns and walks over to her. He bends down over Fiona for a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders and forcefully shakes her.

FIONA: Oh! Oh!

SHREK: Wake up!

FIONA: What?!

SHREK: Are you Princess Fiona?

FIONA: I am... (smiling) awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

SHREK: Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

FIONA: But wait, Sir Knight! This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment? (she tosses the bouquet and lays back down)

SHREK: Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time. (Yanks Fiona out of bed towards the door)

FIONA: Hey, wait. What are you doing? You know, you should sweep me off my feet out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.

Shrek fiddles with the door lock only for it to snap off.

SHREK: You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?

FIONA: Mm-hmm.

Fiona screams as Shrek suddenly smashes the door down, still holding onto her arm. He rushes down the tower's staircase with Fiona in town and grabs a torch.

FIONA: But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something! (pulls her arm away)

DRAGON'S KEEP - INTERIOR

Shrek and Fiona have crossed the lone bridge connecting the tallest tower to the rest of the castle.

SHREK: I don't think so.

FIONA: Can I at least know the name of my champion?

SHREK: Uh, Shrek.

FIONA: Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds out a handkerchief) I pray that you take this favour as a token of my gratitude.

SHREK: (Consfused) Thanks!

Shrek uses her favour to wipe off his sooty face and hands it back to an appalled Fiona. Suddenly they hear the dragon roar and she drops it to the floor.

FIONA: (Angry) You didn't slay the dragon?!

SHREK: It's on my to-do list. Now come on! (takes off running and drags Fiona behind him.)

FIONA: But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That's what all the other knights did!

SHREK: Yeah, right before they burst into flame. (gestures at the skeleton of a knight)

FIONA: That's not the point! (Fiona yanks her arm free) Oh! (Shrek looks around and heads for a wooden door.) Wait. Where are you going? The exit's over there.

SHREK: Well, I have to save my ass.

FIONA: Ugh. What kind of knight are you?

SHREK: One of a kind. (opens the door into the throne room)

THRONE ROOM

The floor of the room is littered with a horde of gold coins and jewels. In the center of the room, Dragon has Donkey wrapped up on her tail

DONKEY: Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time. Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs worriedly) (we see him up close and from a distance as Shrek sneaks into the room) I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not ready for a commitment of, uh, this - - Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude-- (Dragon slides her finger over him) Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? (Dragon looks up to like chandelier above them) Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals.

Shrek grabs a chain connected to the chandelier and swings over Dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.

DONKEY: I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards -- I'd really love to stay, but -- (Dragon tugs at Donkey's tail with her mouth) Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission-- What are you gonna do with that?

Dragon purses her lips and gets ready to kiss Donkey. Shrek starts pulling at the chain until it releases and begins to fall.

DONKEY: Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh!

Shrek lands on Donkey and bumps him out of Dragon's grasp just as she is about to kiss him. Instead the dragon kisses Shrek's butt. She opens her eyes and roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto her head, which forms a collar around her neck. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey take off running. Shrek grabs Donkey in one arm and then grabs Princess Fiona with the other as he runs past her.

DONKEY: Hi, Princess!

FIONA: It talks!

SHREK: Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.

They all gasp as they suddenly stop, having reached the end a cliff. Shrek spots a fallen column that has formed a sort of slide. He jumps on it just as Dragon tries to bite them and slides down it. Unfortunately there is a crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles off and walks lightly.

SHREK: Oh!

Dragon chases after them, the chain of the chandelier still unraveling. They are chased by Dragon through a large hall, her chain passing between multiple columns of stone. Dragon ends up in front of them and breathes fire. Shrek dodges the fire and runs away. He comes to a halt.

SHREK: Okay, you two, head for the exit! (setting down Donkey and Fiona) I'll take care of the dragon.

Shrek grabs a sword and throws it down in between several overlapping chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that is still around the Dragon's neck. Shrek runs back to catch up with Donkey and Fiona.

SHREK: Run!

They all take off running for the exit with Dragon close behind. Dragon breathes fire at them but the three outrun it. As they reach the middle of the bridge the fire burns the bridge and it snaps in half. They hang on to the bridge as they are swung to the other side. Donkey, unable to grab on, falls off but Shrek catches him by the tail. Fiona screams in terror as Dragon flies over the boiling lava to get them. Suddenly the chandelier jerks Dragon back, the sword having lodged itself into a stone column and getting the chain stuck. The group quickly climbs up to safety. Dragon looks angrily roars, then gives a sad whimper.

VOLCANO - EXTERIOR

FIONA: (sliding down the volcano hill) You did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. (behind her Donkey falls down the hill) You're - - You're wonderful. You're... (turns and sees Shrek fall down the hill and crashes into Donkey) a little unorthodox I'll admit. But...thy deed is great, and thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears his throat.) And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?

DONKEY: I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.

Fiona chuckles while Shrek rolls his eyes.

FIONA: The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.

SHREK: Uh, no.

FIONA: Why not?

SHREK: I have helmet hair.

FIONA: Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.

SHREK: No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

FIONA: But, how will you kiss me?

SHREK: What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the job description.

DONKEY: Maybe it's a perk (raises his eyebrows).

FIONA: No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss.

DONKEY: Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you true love?

FIONA: Well...yes.

Donkey and Shrek stare at each other and then burst out laughing.

DONKEY: (Laughing) You think Shrek is your true love!

FIONA: (Annoyed) What is so funny?

SHREK: Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?

Fiona: Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your helmet.

SHREK: Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

FIONA: Just take off the helmet.

SHREK: I'm not going to.

FIONA: Take it off.

SHREK: No!

FIONA: Now!

SHREK: Okay! Easy. As you command,,,your Highness. (takes off his helmet)

Fiona looks at him in shock. Shrek awkwardly grins.

FIONA: You...you're...an ogre.

SHREK: Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

FIONA: Well, yes, actually. (tries to laugh) Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an ogre! (walks off)

SHREK: Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He's the one who wants to marry you.

FIONA: Well then why didn't he come rescue me?

SHREK: Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.

FIONA: But I have to be rescued by my true love! Not by some ogre and his-- his pet.

DONKEY: Well, so much for noble steed.

SHREK: Look princess you're not making my job any easier.

FIONA: I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. (takes a seat on a nearby rock)

SHREK: Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? (Gets up in Fiona's face) I'm a delivery boy.

FIONA: You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

Shrek picks Fiona up and slings her over his shoulder like a bag of potatoes.

FIONA: Ah! Put me down!

SHREK: Ya comin', Donkey?

DONKEY: I'm right behind ya.

FIONA: Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down!

WOODS

A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She hangs limply while Shrek carries her with Donkey walking behind them.

DONKEY: Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten? How do you do that?

FIONA: You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knows what happens when you find your...(Shrek gives her quick shake) Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc the better.

DONKEY: Oh you're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!

FIONA: And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

SHREK: Let me put it this way, princess (drops her on the ground). Men of Farquaad's stature are in,,,,short supply. (he and Donkey laugh)

Shrek washes his face off with the water of a nearby pond.

DONKEY: I don't know. There are those who think...little of him. (they laugh again)

FIONA: Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

SHREK: Yeah, well, maybe you're right, princess. But I'll let you do the "measuring" when you see him tomorrow.

FIONA: (looks at the setting sun, worried) Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?

SHREK: No, that'll take longer. We can keep going.

FIONA: But there's....robbers in the woods.

DONKEY: Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is definitely starting to sound good.

SHREK: Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest.

FIONA: I need to find somewhere to camp now!

Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.

CLIFFSIDE

Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.

SHREK: Hey! Over here.

DONKEY: Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess.

FIONA: No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

SHREK: Homey touches? Like what? (he hears a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona who has torn the bark off of a tree.)

FIONA: A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. (goes into the cave and puts the bark door up behind her)

DONKEY: You want me to read you a bedtime story? Cause I will.

FIONA: I said good night!

Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona still inside.

DONKEY: Shrek, what are you doing?!

SHREK: (laughs) I just--you know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding.

CLIFFSIDE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations to Donkey. SHREK: And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.

DONKEY: Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?

SHREK: The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for. (chuckles) DONKEY: Alright now I know you're making this up.

SHREK: No, look. (pointing to the stars) There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench.

DONKEY: That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.

SHREK: You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.

DONKEY: Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?

SHREK: Our swamp?

DONKEY: You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.

SHREK: We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's no "our". There's just me and my swamp. And the first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land. (turns away from Donkey)

DONKEY: You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.

SHREK: No, do ya think? (turns away again)

DONKEY: Are you hidin' something?

SHREK: Never mind, Donkey. (lies on his back)

DONKEY: Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

SHREK: No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things!

DONKEY: Why don't you want to talk about it?

SHREK: Why do you want to talk about it? (turns)

DONKEY: Why are you blocking?

SHREK: I'm not blocking. (turns)

DONKEY: Oh, yes, you are.

SHREK: Donkey, I'm warning you.

DONKEY: Who you trying to keep out?

SHREK: Everyone! Okay?!

DONKEY: (pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. (grins)

At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to the cave and peaks out. Neither of them see her.

SHREK: Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and walks over to the edge of the cliff and sits down)

DONKEY: Hey what's your problem Shrek? What you got against the whole world anyway? Huh?

SHREK: Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. "Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!" They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.

It's difficult to see Fiona, but she looks remorseful after hearing Shrek. She closes the door.

DONKEY: You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

SHREK: Yeah, I know.

DONKEY: So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

SHREK: Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small...and Annoying.

DONKEY: Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there?

SHREK: That's the moon.

DONKEY: Oh, okay.

DULOC - FARQUAAD'S BEDROOM

Farquaad's room is is filled with items prepared for his wedding, including crowns and wedding outfits. Soft music plays in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.

FARQUAAD: Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess. (grinning)

MIRROR: Hmph. The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.

FARQUAAD: Ah. Perfect.

Farquaad looks down and pulls the sheet up to cover himself as the covers rise.

CLIFFSIDE - MORNING

Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes across a blue bird. She begins to sing, and the bird sings along with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles to keep up with her. Fiona hits a note so high that it causes the bird to explode. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Fiona is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking in his sleep.

DONKEY: (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that. Come on, baby. I said I like it...

SHREK: Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)

DONKEY: Huh? What?

SHREK: Wake up.

DONKEY: What? (stretches and yawns)

FIONA: Good morning. Uh, how do you like your eggs?

DONKEY: Oh, good morning, Princess!

SHREK: What's all this about?

FIONA: You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.

SHREK: Uh, thanks.

Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.

FIONA: Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us. (smiling, walks off)

SHERWOOD FOREST

The three continue their journey back to Duloc. They are walking through the forest and Shrek belches.

DONKEY: Shrek!

SHREK: What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. (laughs)

DONKEY: Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess!

Fiona belches, stopping Shrek and Donkey in their tracks.

FIONA: Thanks.

DONKEY: She's as nasty as you are.

SHREK: (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly what I expected.

FIONA: Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.

She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into a tree.

MONSIEUR HOOD: La liberte! Hey!

SHREK: Princess!

FIONA: Oh! Wait wait--what are you doing?!

MONSIEUR HOOD: Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses up her arm while Fiona pulls back in disgust)...beast.

SHREK: Hey! That's my princess! Go find you own!

MONSIEUR HOOD: Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

FIONA: (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are!

MONSIEUR HOOD: Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men! (laughs)

Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merrymen pop out from the bushes. They begin to sing along with Monsieur Hood.

MERRYMEN: Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

MONSIEUR HOOD: I steal from the rich and give to the needy.

MERRYMAN: He takes a wee percentage,

MONSIEUR HOOD: But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels, man, I'm good.

MERRYMEN: What a guy, Monsieur Hood.

MONSIEUR HOOD: Break it down. I like an honest fight and a saucy little maid...

MERRYMEN: What he's basically saying is he likes to get...

MONSIEUR HOOD: Paid! So...When an ogre in the bush grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.

MERRYMEN: That's bad. That's bad. That's bad!

MONSIEUR HOOD: When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad!

MERRYMEN: He's mad, he's really, really mad!

MONSIEUR HOOD: I'll take my blade and ram it through your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 'cause I'm about to start...

Fiona swings down from the tree limb and kicks Monsieur Hood in the head, knocking him unconscious.

FIONA: Man, that was annoying!

Shrek looks at her in admiration.

MERRYMAN: Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at Fiona but she ducks out of the way)

The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to get out of the way. Fiona demonstrates her martial arts skills and easily beats up every last Merryman. The Merrymen are left on lying on the ground and Fiona walks away.

FIONA: Uh, shall we?

SHREK: Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?

FIONA: What?

SHREK: That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?

FIONA: (Blushing) Well...(laughs) when one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a...(gasps and points) there's an arrow in your butt!

SHREK: What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you look at that? (he goes to pull it out but flinches)

FIONA: Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

DONKEY: Why? What's wrong?

FIONA: Shrek's hurt.

DONKEY: Shrek's hurt! Shrek's hurt?! Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die!

SHREK: Donkey, I'm okay.

DONKEY: You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die! Keep your legs elevated! Turn your head and cough! Does anyone know the Heimlich?!

FIONA: Donkey! (grabs him by the ear) Calm down! If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns.

DONKEY: Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

SHREK & FIONA: Donkey!

DONKEY: Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. (runs off)

SHREK: What are the flowers for?

FIONA: (like it's obvious) For getting rid of Donkey.

SHREK: Ah... (grins)

FIONA: Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out. (gives the arrow a little pull)

SHREK: (jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'.

FIONA: I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

SHREK: No, it's tender.

As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and Shrek keeps dodging her hands.

FIONA: Now, hold on.

SHREK: What you're doing is the opposite of help.

FIONA: Don't move.

SHREK: Look, time out. (puts his hand over Fiona's face)

FIONA: Would you...(moves Shrek's hand away) Okay. What do you propose we do?

ELSEWHERE

Donkey is still looking for the special flower.

DONKEY: Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns.

SHREK: Ow!

DONKEY: Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'! (rips a flower off a nearby bush that just happens to be a blue flower with red thorns)

THE FOREST PATH

SHREK: Ow! Not good.

FIONA: Okay. Okay. I can nearly see it. (Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just about...

SHREK: Ow! Ohh!

He rolls over and Fiona lands on top of him. For a moment they stare into each other's eyes.

DONKEY: Ahem.

SHREK: Nothing happened. (throwing Fiona off of him) We were just, uh...

DONKEY: (Teasing) Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay?

SHREK Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just-- (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh! (he turns to look at Fiona who holds up the arrow with a smile) Ow!

DONKEY: Hey, what's that? (nervous chuckle) That's...is that blood?

Donkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue on their way. There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to Duloc. Shrek craws up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a small stream so that Fiona won't get wet. After crossing over, Fiona puts her hand along Shrek's back. Shrek then gets up as Donkey is just about to cross. The tree and the tree swings back into it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swats and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins eating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers. Shrek catches a frog and blows it up like a balloon to give to Fiona. Fiona catches a snake, blows into its mouth, fashions it into a balloon animal and presents it to Shrek.

WINDMILL - EXTERIOR

The group arrives at an abandoned windmill on a hill overlooking Duloc.

SHREK: (Dejected)There it is, princess. Your future awaits you.

FIONA: That's Duloc?

DONKEY: Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really...(Shrek steps on his hoof)

SHREK: Um, I, uh-- I guess we better move on.

FIONA: Sure. But, Shrek? I'm -- I'm worried about Donkey.

SHREK: What?

FIONA: I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good.

DONKEY: What are you talking about? I'm fine.

FIONA: (kneels to look him in the eyes) That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on your back. (pause) Dead.

SHREK: You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?

FIONA: Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.

DONKEY: I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and when I turn my head like this, look, (turns his neck in a very sharp way until his head is completely sideways) Ow! See?

Shrek and Fiona give each happy looks, having made up an excuse to spend more time together.

SHREK: Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.

FIONA: I'll get the firewood.

DONKEY: Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! (looks down and yelps) I don't have any toes! I think I need a hug.

EVENING

Shrek has built a fire and is cooking the rest of dinner while Fiona eats.

FIONA: Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?

SHREK: Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.

FIONA: No kidding. Well, this is delicious.

SHREK: Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean weed rat stew. (chuckles)

Fiona looks at Duloc and sighs.

FIONA: I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.

SHREK: Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare -- you name it.

FIONA: (smiles) I'd like that.

They gaze into each other's eyes longingly.

SHREK: Um...princess?

FIONA: Yes...Shrek?

SHREK: I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs) Are you gonna eat that?

Shrek points to her last piece of food. Fiona, expecting a different question, removes the weedrat while Shrek is annoyed by the words that couldn't come out. Fiona hands it to Shrek and he grabs onto her hand. The two slowly lean towards each other. Donkey interrupts the moment.

DONKEY: (chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset.

FIONA: (jumps up) Sunset?! Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late.

SHREK: What?

DONKEY: Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here.

Fiona gets worried by what Donkey might say next.

DONKEY: You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?

FIONA: (Relieved) Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside. (walks away)

DONKEY: Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until -- Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

Shrek groans and Fiona chuckles.

FIONA: Good night.

SHREK: Good night.

Fiona goes inside the windmill, gives Shrek a look, and closes the door. Donkey looks at Shrek with a new eye.

DONKEY: Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.

SHREK: Oh, what are you talkin' about?

DONKEY: I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

SHREK: You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

DONKEY: Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in and tell her how you feel.

SHREK: I--there's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, well, you know-- and I'm not sayin' I do, 'cause I don't -- she's a princess, and I'm...

DONKEY: An ogre?

SHREK: Yeah. An ogre.

DONKEY: Hey, where you goin'?

SHREK: To get...more firewood. (sighs)

Donkey looks suspiciously over at the large pile of firewood already piled up. Shrek sits on the hill and gazes out at Duloc until nightfall.

NIGHT

Donkey opens the door to the windmill and walks in. All is quiet and Fiona is nowhere to be seen.

DONKEY: Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you? Princess?

Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her clearly.

DONKEY: It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.

Fiona tries to sneak away but the platform she is walking on breaks. Fiona falls from the railing and lands on a sack of flour. She gets up only but doesn't look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking out.

DONKEY: Aah!

FIONA: Oh, no!

DONKEY: No, help!

FIONA: Shh!

DONKEY: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

FIONA: No, it's okay. It's okay.

DONKEY: What did you do with the princess?!

FIONA: Donkey, I'm the princess.

DONKEY: Aah!

FIONA: It's me, in this body.

DONKEY: Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to her stomach) Can you hear me?

FIONA: Donkey!

DONKEY: (still aimed at her stomach) Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!

FIONA: No!

DONKEY: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

FIONA: (Covering Donkey's mouth) Shh.

DONKEY: (Muffled) Shrek!

FIONA: This is me.

Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he calms down.

DONKEY: Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different.

FIONA: I'm ugly, okay?

DONKEY: Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now--

FIONA: No! I -- I've been this way as long as I can remember.

DONKEY: What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.

FIONA: It only happens when sun goes down. "By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form."

DONKEY: Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.

FIONA: It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this. (begins to cry)

DONKEY: All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24/7.

FIONA: But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look.

DONKEY: Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?

FIONA: I have to. Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.

DONKEY: But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek-- well, you got a lot in common.

FIONA: Shrek?

OUTSIDE

Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his hand.

SHREK: (to himself) Princess, I-- Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and-- well, I don't really like it but I thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd-- uh, uh...(sighs) I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey and Fiona talking.

FIONA: I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek.

Shrek steps back in shock, misunderstanding the conversation's meaning.

FIONA: My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

Shrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks away.

INSIDE:

FIONA: Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell.

DONKEY: You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.

FIONA: No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.

DONKEY: What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?

FIONA: Promise you won't tell. Promise!

DONKEY: All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should.

Donkey steps outside.

DONKEY: (to himself) I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. Look at my eye twitchin'.

Fiona opens the door and watches him walk away. She looks down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back inside the windmill.

MORNING

Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.

FIONA: I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not...I tell him! (she quickly runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want...

Fiona looks and sees the rising sun, and as the sun crests the sky she turns back into a human. Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards her.

FIONA: Shrek! Are you all right? (puts a hand on his shoulder)

SHREK: (shrugs it off) Perfect! Never been better.

FIONA: I --I don't -- There's something I have to tell you.

SHREK: You don't have to tell me anything, princess. I heard enough last night.

FIONA: You heard what I said?

SHREK: Every word.

FIONA: I thought you'd understand.

SHREK: Oh, I understand. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?"

FIONA: But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

SHREK: Yeah? Well, it does.

Fiona looks at him in shock, tears welling in her eyes. Shrek looks past her and spots a group approaching.

SHREK: Ah, right on time. Princess, I've brought you a little something.

Shrek gestures towards the group and Fiona stand with her mouth wide, Farquaad has arrived on horseback with an escort of guards. He is also wearing an outfit that disguises his shortness. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the guards march by.

DONKEY: What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (eyes a guard) (muffled) Who said that? Couldn't have been the donkey. (scurries away)

FARQUAAD: Princess Fiona.

SHREK: As promised. Now hand it over.

FARQUAAD: Very well, ogre. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed. Take it and go before I change my mind.

Shrek snatches the deed out of the hands of a guard and walks away. Fiona is put off by this exchange.

FARQUAAD: Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I am Lord Farquaad.

FIONA: Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... (Watches as Farquaad is lifted off his horse and set down in front of her. He comes up to her waist.)...farewell (forcefully smiles).

FARQUAAD: Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the ogre. It's not like it has feelings.

FIONA: No, you're right. It doesn't.

Shrek is hurt by the comment. Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.

FARQUAAD: Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

FIONA: Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make --

FARQUAAD: (interrupting) Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!

FIONA: No!

Shrek suddenly looks back in hopes that Fiona has changed her mind,

FIONA: I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today. Before the sun sets.

FARQUAAD: Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's so much to do! There's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list. Captain, round up some guests! There's so much to do!

A guard helps Farquaad back up onto the saddle. Another guard offers Fiona assistance, but she jumps on its back by herself. She looks out at Shrek.

FIONA: (Coldly) Fare-thee-well, ogre.

Farquaad's whole party begins to head back to Duloc. Donkey watches them go.

DONKEY: Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.!

SHREK Yeah? So what?

DONKEY: Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to her last night, She's - -

SHREK: I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?!

DONKEY: Shrek, I-- I wanna go with you.

SHREK: I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

DONKEY: But, I thought...

SHREK: Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong! (stomps off)

DONKEY: Shrek.

Montage of different scenes. Shrek arrives back home. The swamp is a mess but the fairytale creatures are gone. Fiona is being fitted for her wedding dress. Shrek throws a sunflower into the fireplace. Farquaad proudly tries on his crown. Fiona stares at her wedding cake, pushing down a figure of Farquaad to show his actual height. She notices a suit of armor that reminds her of Shrek. Donkey stops by a river where he finds Dragon crying, both of them happy to see each other. Shrek and Fiona both try to eat dinner but start crying

SHREK'S HOME

Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes outside to investigate.

SHREK: Donkey? (Donkey ignores him) What are you doing?

DONKEY: (Pushing some wood around) I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one.

SHREK: Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.

DONKEY: It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half.

SHREK: Oh! Your half. Hmm.

DONKEY: Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.

SHREK: Back off!

DONKEY: No, you back off.

SHREK: This is my swamp!

DONKEY: Our swamp.

SHREK: (grabs the tree branch Donkey is working with) Let go, Donkey!

DONKEY: You let go.

SHREK: Stubborn jackass!

DONKEY: Smelly ogre.

SHREK: Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks away)

DONKEY: Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.

SHREK: Well, I'm through with you. (walks off)

DONKEY: (follows him) Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

SHREK: Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

DONKEY: Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!

SHREK: Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in the back! (goes into the outhouse and slams the door)

DONKEY: Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings.

SHREK: Go away!

DONKEY: There you are, doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you.

SHREK: Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of you talking.

DONKEY: She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody else.

SHREK: (opens the door and comes out) She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?

DONKEY: Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. Right? Right?

SHREK: Donkey!

DONKEY: No!

SHREK: Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? (sigh) I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?

DONKEY: Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

SHREK: Right. Friends?

DONKEY: Friends.

SHREK: So, um, what did Fiona say about me?

DONKEY: What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?

SHREK: The wedding! We'll never make it in time.

DONKEY: Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I have a way. (whistles)

Suddenly Dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so they can climb on.

SHREK: Donkey?

DONKEY: I guess it's just my animal magnetism. They both laugh.

SHREK: Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a noogie)

DONKEY: All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install the seat belts yet.

They climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for Duloc.

DULOC CATHEDRAL - INTERIOR

Fiona and Farquaad are standing at the altar. The church is packed with citizens. A man with a prompter card holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'.

BISHOP: People of Duloc, we gather here today to bear witness to the union....

FIONA: (eyeing the setting sun) Um-

BISHOP: ...of our new king...

FIONA: Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?

FARQUAAD: (chuckles and then motions to the bishop to indulge Fiona) Go on.

DULOC CATHEDRAL - EXTERIOR

A large group of guards stand outside the cathedral on watch. Suddenly Dragon lands nearby. The guards all take off running.

DONKEY: (to Dragon) Go ahead, have some fun. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? (she nods and goes after the guards) Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't you?

SHREK: (At the door) What are you talking about?

DONKEY: There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!"

SHREK: I don't have time for this!

DONKEY: Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! (pushes Shrek against the door) Look, you love this woman, don't you?

SHREK: Yes.

DONKEY: You wanna hold her?

SHREK: Yes.

DONKEY: Please her?

SHREK: Yes!

DONKEY: (singing James Brown style) Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. (normal) The chicks love that romantic crap!

SHREK: All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?

DONKEY: We gotta check it out.

INTERIOR

As the bishop talks we see Donkey through one of the windows as Shrek tosses him up so he can see.

BISHOP: And so, by the power vested in me...

EXTERIOR

SHREK: What do you see?

DONKEY: The whole town's in there.

INTERIOR

BISHOP: I now pronounce you husband and wife...

EXTERIOR

DONKEY: They're at the altar.

INTERIOR

PRIEST: ...king and queen.

EXTERIOR

DONKEY: Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

SHREK: Oh, for the love of Pete!

Shrek runs inside without catching Donkey, who hits the ground hard.

INTERIOR

Fiona and Farquaad are leaning in to kiss when Shrek bursts through the doors.

SHREK: (running toward the alter) I object!

FIONA: Shrek?

Fiona initially looks happily surprised to see him, but quickly becomes upset.

FARQUAAD: Oh, now what does he want?

The whole congregation gasps as they see Shrek head towards the altar. They respond positively to him and begin to do "the wave".

SHREK: (to congregation) Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.

FIONA: What are you doing here?

FARQUAAD: Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding...

SHREK: Fiona! I need to talk to you.

FIONA: Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me--(she leans over to kiss Farquaad)

SHREK: (yanks her away) But you can't marry him.

FIONA: And why not?

SHREK: Because...because he's just marrying you so he can be king.

FARQUAAD: Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

SHREK: He's not your true love.

FIONA: And what do you know about true love?

SHREK: Well, I--uh--I mean...

FARQUAAD: Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen in love with the princess! Oh, good Lord. (laughs)

Farquaad gestures to the man with the prompter card holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The whole congregation laughs.

FARQUAAD: An ogre and a princess! (laughs)

FIONA: Shrek, is this true?

FARQUAAD: Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me!

Farquaad puckers his lips and leans toward her, but she pulls back in disgust. She looks towards the window to see the setting sun.

FIONA: "By night one way, by day another." (to Shrek) I wanted to show you before.

Fiona backs up and gives Shrek a sheepish smile. As the sun sets, she changes into her ogre self. The crowd gasps and one person faints.

SHREK: Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona smiles)

FARQUAAD: Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of my sight now!

A large amount of guards run in and grab ahold of Shrek and Fiona.

FARQUAAD: Get them! Get them both!

FIONA: No, no! Shrek!

Shrek and Fiona try to grab each other's arms but are pulled away from each other. Farquaad grabs ahold of his crown and puts it on.

FARQUAAD: This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that makes me king! See? See?

FIONA: No, let go of me! Shrek!

SHREK: No!

FARQUAAD: Don't just stand there, you morons.

SHREK: (knocking away a guard) Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!

Shrek fights back and knocks out a few of the guards, but they are able to subdue him through sheer numbers

FARQUAAD: I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll beg for death to save you!

FIONA: No, Shrek!

FARQUAAD: (hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And as for you, my wife...

SHREK: Fiona!

FARQUAAD: I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! I'm king!

Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles.

FARQUAAD: I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have (looks up) -- Aaaah!

Donkey and Dragon crash through the windows and Dragon eats Farquaad, swallowing him whole. Most of the guards run away.

DONKEY: All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it. (Dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on the edge!

Dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth and falls to the ground.

DONKEY: Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

The congregation cheers.

DONKEY: Go ahead, Shrek.

SHREK: Uh, Fiona?

FIONA: Yes, Shrek?

SHREK: I -- I love you.

FIONA: Really?

SHREK: Really, really.

FIONA: (smiles) I love you too.

Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes 'Awwww' on the back and shows it to the congregation. Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted up into the air and she hovers while the magic works around her.

WHISPERS: "Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true form. Take love's true form. Take love's true form."

Suddenly Fiona's eyes open wide. She's consumed by the spell and then is slowly lowered to the ground.

SHREK: (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right?

FIONA: (standing up, she's still an ogre) Well, yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful.

SHREK: But you are beautiful.

They smile at each other.

DONKEY: (chuckles) I was hoping this would be a happy ending.

Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...

THE SWAMP

...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm a Believer' by Smash Mouth plays in the background. Among the attendees are the fairytale creatures once banished to the swamp, as well as a few Duloc Guards. Shrek and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. They end get into a cat fight and Dragon catches the bouquet instead. Donkey looks nervous, but Shrek and Fiona give him reassuring looks. The Gingerbread Man has been mended somewhat and now has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane.

GINGERBREAD MAN: God bless us, every one.

The guests party and dance as Donkey takes over singing the song. Shrek and Fiona ride away in their carriage. Cut to a storybook that reads "And they lived ugly ever after...THE END".

DONKEY: (as he's done singing and we fade to black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

THE END

GOOD LUCK, CHIHIRO WE'LL MEET AGAIN Chihiro. Chihiro!

We're almost there.

This really is the middle of nowhere.

I'll have to shop in the next town.

It'll be great, once we get used to it.

Look, there's the school.

That's your new school, Chihiro.

It doesn't look so bad.

I liked my old school...

Mommy... My flowers died.

No wonder, the way you clung to them.

A little water when we get there and they'll perk right up.

My very first bouquet is farewell flowers, how sad.

What about that rose you got for your birthday.

One rose isn't a bouquet.

You dropped your card.

I'm opening the window.

C'mon now, behave yourself. It's a big day for all of us.

Hey... Did I take the wrong turn?

I don't get it.

That must be it, look.

It must be that blue one over there.

That's it.

I must've missed the exit.

I bet this road'll get us there.

This is always how you get us lost.

Just a little farther, OK.

What are those little houses?

They're shrines. People pray to them.

Daddy, are we lost?

We're fine, we've got four-wheel drive.

Sit down, Chihiro.

You're going to kill us.

A tunnel.

What's this strange building?

Must be the entrance.

Honey...

Let's go back, honey.

Chihiro.

No...

It's just plaster.

This building's pretty new.

The wind's going in.

What is it?

Let's have a look. There's a way through.

It's creepy, Daddy, let's go back.

No need to be scared.

Just a little farther, OK?

The moving van'll get there before us.

So, let 'em, they've got the keys. Let the movers move us.

I know, but...

No! I won't go.

Daddy, let's go back.

Nothing to be scared of.

I won't go.

Chihiro, you wait in the car.

Mommy.

Wait.

Watch your step.

You'll make me trip, Chihiro, clinging like that.

Where are we?

Say, do you hear that?

It's a train.

Maybe we're near the station.

Let's go and find out.

What are those houses doing here?

I knew it.

This must be an abandoned theme park.

They built so many in the early '90s, but they all went down with the economy.

This must be one of 'em.

What! No.

Let's go back, Daddy.

C'mon.

Mommy, that building's moaning.

It's just the wind.

What a lovely spot.

We should've brought our lunch with us.

They were making a river.

Hey, you smell that?

See, it smells great.

You're right.

Maybe they're still open.

Hurry up, Chihiro.

Wait for me.

This way.

Can you believe it, they're all restaurants.

Where is everybody?

Over there.

Hey.

In here.

How amazing!

Hello, anybody here?

Come in, Chihiro, it looks delicious.

Hello!

Oh, don't worry. We can pay them when they get back.

You're right. That one looks great...

I wonder what this is called.

Delicious! Chihiro, taste it.

I don't want to.

Let's go! They're gonna be mad at us.

Don't worry, you've got Daddy here.

I've got credit cards and cash.

Take some, Chihiro, it's so tender.

Mustard.

Thank you.

Mommy! Daddy!

OIL

OIL

OIL

Weird...

OIL

BATHHOUSE

There's a train.

You're not allowed here. Go back.

Wha--

It's almost night! Leave before it gets dark.

BATHHOUSE They're lighting the lamps. Go.

I'll distract them. Get back across the river.

OIL

What's his problem?

Daddy.

Daddy, let's go home.

Let's go, Daddy.

Daddy! Mommy!

Mommy!

It's water.

This can't be...

I'm dreaming, dreaming.

Wake up!

Wake... up...

It's just a dream, a dream.

Go away, disappear.

Disappear.

I can see through.

It's a dream, it's got to be.

Don't be afraid, I'm a friend.

No, no, no.

Open your mouth and eat this.

Unless you eat something from this world, you'll vanish.

No!

Don't worry.

It won't turn you into a pig.

Chew it and swallow.

Good girl, you're fine.

See for yourself.

I'm back again...

You see? Now come.

What about my mom and dad? They didn't really turn into pigs, did they?

You can't see them now, but you will.

Quiet.

It's looking for you.

There's no time, let's run.

I... I can't stand! Oh, no.

My legs don't work.

Calm, now. Take a deep breath.

In the name of the wind and the water within thee... Unbind her.

Get up.

NO ENTRY

OIL

Hold your breath while we're on the bridge.

Even a tiny breath will break the spell and the attendants will see you.

I'm scared.

Be calm.

Welcome. Always nice to see you.

Welcome.

I'm back from my task.

Welcome back, sir.

A deep breath...

And hold...

Welcome back! We missed you!

Hang on, we're almost...

Master Haku.

Where have you...

Wha... A human.

Run.

What...

Master Haku!

Chase after it. A human intruder.

I smell humans! The stench of humans.

They know you're here.

I'm sorry, I took a breath.

No, Chihiro, you did very well.

Listen and I'll tell you what to do.

Stay here, and they'll find you.

I'll distract them. In the meantime, you escape.

No, don't go! Stay with me, please.

You have no choice, if you want to survive here.

And save your parents, too.

So they did turn into pigs... I wasn't dreaming...

Be still...

When things quiet down, go out by the back gate.

Take the stairs, all the way down.

Until you reach the boiler room, where they stoke the fires.

Kamaji's there, so look for him.

Ask him for work.

Kamaji?

Even if he refuses, insist.

If you don't work, Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

Yubaba.

You'll see. She's the sorceress who rules our world.

Kamaji will turn you away, trick you into you leaving, but keep on asking him for work.

It'll be hard work, but it will give you a chance.

Then even Yubaba can't harm you.

OK.

Master Haku.

I have to go.

Remember, Chihiro. I'm your friend.

How do you know my name?

I've known you since you were small.

My name is Haku.

Here I am!

Master Haku, Yubaba wants you.

I know. It's about my task.

Um...

Excuse me.

Um...

Um, are you Kamaji?

Um, Haku sent me here. Please let me work here.

Darn, all at once...

Get to work, you little runts.

I'm... Kamaji.

Slave to the boilers that heat the baths.

Step on it, boys.

Um, please let me work here.

I've got all the help I need. The place is full of soot.

Plenty of replacements.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Please wait.

Outta the way.

Um... What should I do with this?

Do I just leave it?

Finish what you start.

Hey, you runts! Wanna turn back into soot?

And you, watch it. You can't just take someone's job.

If they don't work, the spell wears off.

Got no work for you here. Look elsewhere.

You sootballs got a problem?

Get to work! To work.

Chow time.

What? You guys at it again.

Cut it out.

Where's your bowl?

I keep telling you to leave it out.

Meal time! Take a break!

A human! You're in trouble.

They're having a fit about it upstairs.

That's my granddaughter.

Granddaughter?

Says she wants to work, but I've got all the help I need.

Would you take her to Yubaba?

The girl can handle her, I'm sure.

Not a chance! And risk my life?

Take this, then. A roasted newt.

Real quality.

If you want to work, you'll have to make a deal with Yubaba.

Might as well try your luck.

Fine! You there, follow me.

Can't you even manage a "Yes ma'am," or "Thank you"?

Yes... yes ma'am.

You sure are slow. Hurry.

Yes ma'am.

What do you need shoes for! Or socks!

Did you even thank Kamaji?

He's looking out for you.

Thank you very much, sir.

Good luck.

Yubaba lives way up at the top, in the back.

Get over here.

You wanna lose your nose?

We're almost there.

Right.

Here we are.

Wel... welcome.

This elevator is not in service, sir. Please use another.

DOWN ONLY

-He's following us... -Quit gawking.

UP

Here we are.

Your room is on the right.

Lin.

Yes.

What's that smell?

It's human. You reek of human.

Is that so?

I smell it, I do. Smells mighty tasty, too.

You're hiding something.

Tell me the truth, now.

This smell.

Roasted... Gimme.

Not a chance. It's for the other girls.

I'm begging you. I'll settle for a leg.

Anyone going up, pull down on the lever.

SECOND SKY

SKY

OIL

Not going to knock?

What a pathetic little girl.

Come closer...

I said closer.

Ow...

You're making a racket. Keep it down.

Um...

Please let me work here.

Stop babbling.

You're just a useless weakling.

Besides, this is no place for humans.

It's a bath house, where eight million spirits can rest their weary bones.

Your parents had some nerve.

Gobbling up our guests' food like pigs!

Just desserts, I'd say.

And you'll never see... your world again either.

You'd make a lovely piglet.

Or maybe a lump of coal.

I see you're trembling.

Actually, I'm impressed you made it this far.

Someone must've helped you.

I must thank your friend.

Just who was it, my dear? You can tell me.

Please let me work here.

Not that again!

I want to work here!

Shut up!

Why should I hire you?

Anyone can see you're a lazy, spoiled, crybaby.

Stupid to boot.

I've nothing for you.

Forget it.

I've got all the bums I need around here.

Or maybe you'd like the worst, nastiest job I've got, until you breathe your very last breath?

Stop that! What's wrong...

I'll be right there. That's a good baby, now.

What? You still here! Get out.

I want to work here.

Don't shout.

I'll be right there...

That's a good baby, there, there.

Please let me work!

OK, OK, just pipe down.

There, there, now.

Your contract.

Sign your name.

I'll put you to work.

But one peep out of you about anything, and I'll turn you right into a piglet.

Um, I sign my name here?

That's right. Quit dilly-dallying and do it.

Unbelievable.

That ridiculous oath I took.

To give a job to whoever asks.

-Signed it? -Yes.

-You're Chihiro, huh? -Yes.

What an extravagant name.

CHIHIRO SEN

From now on, you'll be Sen.

You got that? You're Sen.

Answer me, Sen.

Yes...

Did you call?

This child's starting work as of now. Look after her.

Yes.

Your name?

What?

Chi... Oh, I'm Sen.

Follow me, then, Sen.

Haku... Um...

No idle chatter.

Call me Master Haku.

Even on Yubaba's orders...

We can't allow humans.

Her contract's signed.

What...

Thank you, everyone.

-Don't send her to us. -Can't bear that human stink.

Three days of eating our food and her smell will vanish.

If she's still useless then, fry her, boil her, do with her as you will.

Back to work! Where's Lin?

Don't dump her on me.

You wanted help?

That's right, Lin's just perfect.

-Go, Sen. -Yes, Sir.

What a pain. You're gonna pay for this.

Off you go.

C'mon.

So you pulled it off, huh?

You're so thick, I was worried.

Keep your wits, now. If you need something, ask me, OK?

What's wrong?

I'm dizzy.

So this is our room.

A little food and some sleep and you'll be fine.

You wash your own apron! Pants.

You're so puny.

Too big...

Um, Lin...

What?

Are there two Hakus here?

Two?

Of him? I sure hope not.

Still too big.

He's Yubaba's henchman. Watch out for him.

Where the...

Here it is.

What's wrong? Are you OK?

What's all the fuss, Lin?

New girl. Says she feels faint.

Meet me at the bridge. I'll show you your mother and father.

My shoes...

Thank you.

BATHHOUSE

BATHHOUSE

Follow me.

Daddy, Mommy, it's me.

It's Sen.

Mommy, Daddy.

Are they sick or hurt?

No, they ate too much. Sleeping it off.

They don't even remember being human.

Daddy, Mommy, I promise I'll save you.

Don't get too fat, or they'll eat you.

Hide these.

I thought they were gone.

You'll need them to get home.

This was a farewell card...

Chi-hi-ro.

Chihiro... That's my name.

Yubaba rules others by stealing their names.

You're Sen here, but keep your real name a secret.

She almost got mine. I'd nearly turned into Sen.

If she steals your name, you'll never find your way home.

I no longer remember mine.

Your real name?

But it's strange. I remembered yours.

Go ahead, eat, you must be hungry.

I don't want to.

I put a spell on it to give you back your strength, eat it.

You've had a hard time. Eat some more.

OIL Can you find your way back?

Yes, Haku, thank you. I'll work very hard.

Good.

Where were you? I was worried.

I'm sorry.

Outta my way.

Is that the best you can do?

You and Sen get the big tub as of today.

What! But that's Frog work.

Orders from the top. Better give it your all.

Aren't you... getting wet?

Hurry up, Sen!

Coming!

I'll leave this open.

-On the big tub, Lin? -Lay off me.

Jerks! They haven't scrubbed this in ages.

This bath is reserved for our filthiest guests.

It's caked with sludge.

Lin, Sen, first customers are here.

Right away...

Shoot, clearly harassment.

This tub needs an herbal soak. Get a tag from the foreman.

A tag?

-An herbal soak tag. -Right.

What's a foreman, Lin?

Something's coming. I wonder what.

Some useless scum, under cover of rainfall...

I can't waste that on you.

Why good morning!

Feeling refreshed?

For Kasuga sama.

One deluxe sulfur soak.

No point in standing there. Back to work.

Scrub with your hands.

Good morning!

Your hands, I say.

But... Um... It has to be an herbal soak.

You sure are dense.

Oh... A fragrant bath coming up. Relax and enjoy...

Hello, foreman here. Yes, ma'am...

Thank you so much.

That's not...

Hey, you, wait.

-What's the trouble? -Why, nothing at all...

We have an intruder.

Is it human?

You figure it out. Haku's out today.

Wow, you got a really good one.

This goes to Kamaji.

Water'll be right up, it's not too busy now.

Yank on this for hot water.

You're such a klutz.

Look at that color!

That's the dried worm salts.

With water this murky, who's gonna see the sludge?

Yank it again when it's full. It'll stop.

Go ahead, let go.

I'll get our breakfast.

Sure.

Ouch.

Um... The bath's not ready yet.

But, there are so many...

Wha... They're for me?

But... I don't need this many.

No, just one.

Madam.

It's a Stink Spirit?

An Extra Large Stinker at that.

Headed straight for the bridge!

Please turn back!

Please withdraw! The bath is closed for the night.

Please withdraw, please.

Peeeee-ewy...

Something's fishy. Didn't seem like a Stink Spirit, to me...

Well, now that it's here, better go greet it.

Just try to get rid of it, as fast as you can.

Please retire to your rooms! So terribly sorry.

Please hurry.

Lin and Sen, Yubaba's calling.

Yes sir.

Listen, this is your first job.

You take this customer to the big tub.

Um...

One peep out of you and you're coal.

Got that?

It has arrived.

Don't insult the customer.

Welggum to our bazzs...

Oh... Money...

Sen, hurry, take it.

Yes ma'am.

Zhow him de bazz.

Pl... Pleazze.

Sen!

Awful...

Our food...

Open the windows! All of 'em.

What? Just a minute.

Truly filthy.

This is no laughing matter.

Let's see what she does.

Ah, she intends to re-fill the tub.

Oh, no, soiling the walls with those filthy hands.

Did you give Sen new tags?

Never, what a waste!

Oh no! All that precious herbal formula!

Sen! Sen, where are you?

Lin!

You OK?

I asked Kamaji to give us all the water he's got!

He's sending the best herbal soak ever.

Thank you. He's got a thorn stuck in him.

A thorn?

It's in so deep, it won't come out.

Thorn!? She said thorn?

Rally the help downstairs.

Step on it.

Sen and Lin.

That's no Stink Spirit in there.

Grab this rope.

Yes ma'am.

-Hold on tight! -Yes ma'am.

Hustle now, and get the women to help them.

I tied it.

Everyone, all of you! All together now.

Heave!

And heave!

And heave!

And heave!

A bicycle.

As I suspected! Now, pull!

And heave.

Sen, you OK?

Well done...

Gold! It's gold!

Hands off! That's company property!

Be still. Our guest is still with us.

Sen, you're in our guest's way. Get out and open the door.

Open the main gates! He's leaving!

Sen! You did great! You made us a bundle!

That River Spirit's famous.

You can all learn from Sen.

Sake's on the house, tonight.

Now! Time to hand over all that gold you picked up.

Want some? I swiped it.

Thank you.

Man, oh, man.

I didn't see Haku.

Not Haku again.

He just disappears sometimes.

They say Yubaba makes him do bad stuff.

Really...

-Lights out, Lin -Right.

There's a town. Looks like the ocean...

What did you expect after all that rain?

Some day, I swear I'll get to that town. I'm gonna get out of here.

What's wrong?

Gold.

Who are you? You're no customer.

You're not allowed in there.

Hey! It's gold, gold! It's for me.

You can make gold.

Gimme!

Who goes there?

It's way past bedtime.

Hey boss, I'm hungry.

Starving.

That voice...

There, I'll pay you now.

I'm a customer, I want a bath!

Wake everyone up.

Mommy, Daddy, the River Spirit gave me this cake.

I'm sure if you eat it, you'll turn back into people.

Dad, Mom, where are you?

Dad!

Bad dream.

Lin...

Where is everybody?

Wow... it really did turn into an ocean!

I can see where Mom and Dad are from here.

Kamaji's already lit the fires? Did I sleep that long?

The customer's waiting. Hurry it up!

Serve everything you've got, even leftovers.

Sen!

Lin!

I was just going to wake you up. Look.

Real gold! He gave it to me.

This guest's a real high roller.

Please, sir, try this.

Taste the very best.

Throw us some gold.

Your blessings.

I'm starving, bring it all.

That guest...

Come, Sen, Yubaba's still asleep. Now's your chance!

I'm going to see Kamaji.

I wouldn't go right now.

He's in a foul mood 'cause they woke him up.

Let's go back for more, Lin.

What if I don't recognize my parents?

I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

The dragon I saw before!

It's coming this way.

What are they? Not birds!

Fight back, Haku! This way!

Haku?

Haku!

Oh... It's just paper...

Haku? That is you, right?

Are you hurt? Those paper birds are gone.

You're safe, now.

He's going to Yubaba...

Oh, no! He'll die.

The richest man himself has come To grace us with his presence Welcome.

Time to beg for tips Time to start begging Now beg

-Please, sir! -Over here.

Gold springs from his palms.

Toss some this way, sir.

What are you doing?

I'm going upstairs.

No, you don't. What's this?

It's blood!

Move, move. Let our guest through.

Thank you for helping me before.

Don't just stand there...

I don't want any. Don't need any.

I'm busy, please excuse me.

Quiet! Quiet down.

Back, get back.

Please forgive her manners.

After all, the girl is only human and new here...

Wipe that smile off your face. I saw that look.

Why, I would never...

He ate them!

Yubaba!

We're in a fine mess, now.

Actually, he's a No Face.

That's right, a No Face.

Your greed attracted quite a guest, all right.

Don't do anything stupid until I get down there.

Look, the carpet's a mess. Get Haku out of here.

He's no use to me now.

Sleeping outside of your crib again.

Oh, I'm sorry, you were sleeping like such a good baby.

Baba still has work to do.

Go back to sleep now. Good baby.

Ouch, let go!

Oh, thank you for helping me.

But I'm in a hurry. Please let me go.

You came here to make me sick.

Bad germs outside, bad.

I'm a human. Maybe you never saw one before.

You'll get sick out there.

Stay here and play with me.

Are you sick?

I'm in here 'cause I'll get sick outside.

It's staying in here that'll make you sick.

You see, somebody I really care about got hurt very badly.

So I've got to go right now. Please let go of my arm.

If you go, I'll start crying.

If I cry, Baba will come and kill you.

I'll break your little arm.

That hurts!

Please, I'll come play with you later.

No, I wanna play now.

That's blood! Get it! It's blood.

Haku!

Stop, go away! Scat, scat.

Haku! It is you, right?

Hang on.

Be quiet! Haku!

Shoo, go away.

Oh, no.

I'm not afraid of blood. I'll cry if you don't play.

Please be a good boy and wait.

If you don't play with me, I'll cry...

Please, wait.

What a racket! Simmer down.

You're a little butterball, aren't you...

Guess I'm still a little transparent.

Baba.

Oh, dear, can't you even tell me from your own mother?

There, that gives you a little more freedom.

Let's see now... What shall we turn you into?

This is our little secret.

You tell anyone, I'll rip your mouth out.

Who are you?

Yubaba's twin sister.

Thanks to you, I've had a good look at this place, enjoyed myself.

Now hand over the dragon.

What do you want with Haku? He's badly hurt.

That dragon's a thief, my sister's lackey.

Stole a precious seal from my house.

Haku would never! He's so kind.

All dragons are kind. Kind and stupid.

Eager to learn my sister's magical ways.

This boy here will do anything that greedy woman wants.

Move away.

It's too late for him anyway.

The seal was protected by a charm...

Any who try to steal it must die.

No, you can't.

What's gotten into them?

Hey there, cut it out! Go back to your room.

Oh, dear, seems I was careless.

Haku! Oh, no!

Haku.

What on earth is this? Hey! Just wait!

Haku.

Does it hurt?

This is serious.

Haku, don't give up!

Oh, no, he's going to die!

There's something inside him that's killing him.

Inside him?

It's a good spell. Nothing I can do.

Haku, the River Spirit gave me this.

Eat it, maybe it'll help.

Haku, open your mouth.

Please, Haku, eat it.

See, it's safe.

Is it an herbal cake?

Open. That's a good boy...

That's it.

Swallow.

He spit it out! That's it!

The seal!

It got away! There! Over there.

Gross, gross, Sen! Totally gross.

Clean.

Haku took this from Yubaba's sister, Kamaji.

From Zeniba? A witch's seal.

Precious loot, I'd say.

Oh... I knew it was Haku!

Look, Kamaji, it's Haku!

Haku!

Kamaji! He's not breathing!

Yes he is, but he's still very ill from the spell...

That should calm him some.

Haku turned up one day, just like you.

He said he wanted to learn magic.

I didn't approve... of him becoming a sorcerer's apprentice...

I warned him, but he wouldn't listen.

Said he had nowhere left to go. He signed up to be Yubaba's apprentice.

As time went by, he turned increasingly pale, and his eyes took on a sharp gleam.

Kamaji, I'm going to give this back to Yubaba's sister.

Give it back, apologize, and ask her to help Haku.

Tell me where she lives.

Go to Zeniba's?

She's one scary sorceress.

Please.

Haku helped me. Now I want to help him.

You can get there all right...

But getting back...

Wait here.

Let's see now... It's around here, I think...

Everyone, I need my shoes and my clothes, please.

Sen! I've been looking for you everywhere.

Lin.

That's Haku. What happened here?

Who are these guys?

My new friends.

Yubaba's tearing the place apart looking for you.

The big tipper turned out to be a horrible monster, No Face.

Yubaba says you led him here.

Maybe I did.

You serious?

I just thought he was a customer...

He's already swallowed three of our people.

Found it! Here it is, Sen.

We're busy, gramps.

You can use this.

TRAIN TICKETS Train tickets. Where'd you get them?

I've had them for 40 years.

Now listen, it's the sixth stop, called Swamp Bottom.

Swamp Bottom.

That's right, it's the sixth stop.

The sixth stop.

Make sure you get it right. There used to be a return train, but these days it's a one-way ride. Still interested.

Yup. I'll walk back, along the tracks.

But what about Yubaba?

I'll go to her now.

I promise I'll be back, Haku. You can't die.

What's going on here?

Don't you see? It's called... love...

It just keeps getting bigger.

Don't let it swallow me.

Here she comes.

Thank goodness, Sen.

Yubaba can't control him.

There's no need to get upset. I'm sure Sen will turn up.

Where's Sen! I want Sen.

Go, hurry.

Yubaba, it's Sen.

Where were you?

Sen has come, dear guest. We'll be right with you.

What took you so long! This is a complete disaster.

Suck up to him and squeeze all his gold out of him.

What's that filthy rat?

Don't you recognize him?

Of course not, how disgusting.

Now, in you go.

Call if you need us.

Is she all right in there by herself?

Want to take her place?

Try this, it's yummy.

Want some gold? I'm not giving it to anybody else.

Come over here, Sen.

What is it you want? You can tell me.

Where did you come from?

There's someplace I have to go right away.

You should go back where you came from.

You can't help me with what I want.

Where's your home? Don't you have a mom and dad?

I don't wanna...

I'm lonely...

Can't you get back home?

I want Sen.

Take the gold.

-Are you going to eat me? -Take it.

Take it.

If you're going to eat me, have this first.

I was saving it for my parents, but you can have it.

Sen.

Girl! What did you feed me?

Out of my way!

Not on my premises!

Over here!

Here!

You'll pay for this.

Sen, over here!

There he is. Over here!

Don't call him over.

He's only bad in the bath house. He needs to get out of there.

But take him where?

I don't know...

You don't know... He's following us.

From here, you walk.

You'll find the station.

Thank you.

You better come back.

I know I called you a klutz!

I take it back!

No Face, if you so much as touch that girl, you'll pay for it.

There it is.

Train's coming, here we go.

I'm riding to Swamp Bottom.

You want to come, too?

Him too, please.

Come here.

Behave yourself, OK?

Kamaji.

Oh, Haku... You're awake.

Where's Sen?

What happened? Please tell me.

Don't you remember anything?

Just little pieces.

Chihiro kept calling my name in the darkness.

I followed her voice and woke up lying here...

Chihiro, huh...

Her real name's Chihiro.

Can't beat the power of love...

This gold hardly covers the damage.

That fool, Sen.

She just cost me a fortune.

But, Sen did save us, after all.

Silence!

She started it all, and now she's run away.

Even abandoned her own parents!

They must be fine fat pigs by now. Turn them into bacon or ham.

Please wait.

Master Haku.

What, you still alive?

You still can't see that you've lost something precious.

Don't get fresh with me.

Since when do you talk that way?

Baby...

Baby!

It's just sand.

Baby!

Where are you, baby?

Come out, please.

You!

Tell me!

Where did you hide my baby?

He's with Zeniba.

Zeniba?

I get it, that evil witch.

So she thinks she's beaten me.

So, what's your plan?

I'll bring baby back.

But in exchange, return Sen and her parents to the human world.

And what becomes of you?

Let's say I tear you to pieces after sending them back!

I think this is the right stop...

Let's go.

You can ride on my shoulder.

Come in.

Excuse us.

Well, hurry up and come in, then.

C'mon.

So you all made it.

Um...

Have a seat.

I'll make you some tea.

Zeniba, Haku stole this from you. I brought it back.

Do you know what this is?

No, but I know it's very precious.

I'm here to apologize for Haku. I'm sorry.

-You felt fine while you held it? -What?

What's this? The spell is gone.

I'm sorry. I stepped on that strange bug that was on the seal and squashed it.

Squashed it?

You know, my sister snuck that bug into the dragon, so she could control her apprentice.

Squashed it...

You sit too.

You're No Face, aren't you? You sit, too.

Oh, um, please turn them back into themselves.

Why my dears, the spell's long broken.

You can turn yourselves back.

My sister and I are two halves of a whole, but we really don't get along.

You've seen what bad taste she has.

Sorceress twins are just a recipe for trouble.

I'd like to help you, dear, but there's nothing I can do.

It's one of our rules here.

You've got to take care of your parents and that dragon boyfriend of yours, on your own.

But, um, can't you even give me a hint?

I feel like Haku and I met a long time ago.

In that case, it's easy.

Nothing that happens, is ever forgotten, even if you can't remember it.

It's already late. Why don't you stay the night?

You boys give me a hand.

Keep at it.

That's right, you're terrific. You're a big help...

A magic one won't do the trick.

Pull it through there... And do it again.

I really have to go home, Granny.

Haku could die while I'm just sitting here...

They might eat my mom and dad.

Just wait a little longer.

There we are.

Use it to tie back your hair.

It's so pretty.

It'll protect you. I made it from the thread they spun.

Thank you.

What good timing. We've got another guest, let him in.

Sure.

Haku!

Thank goodness.

Aren't you hurt? You sure you're OK?

Thank goodness.

Good timing, I'd say.

Look, Granny, Haku's alive.

Haku, I no longer blame you for what you did.

Just be sure you protect the girl.

OK, boys, time to go home.

Come back soon.

You, stick around and be my helper.

Granny!

Thank you, I'm going now.

I'm sure you can manage everything.

My real name is Chihiro.

Chihiro... What a nice name.

-Take good care of it, it's yours. -I will!

-Off you go. -Yes.

Thank you, granny. Good bye.

Listen, Haku.

I don't remember it, but my mom told me...

Once, when I was little, I fell into a river.

She said they'd drained it and built things on top.

But I've just remembered.

The river was called...

Its name was the Kohaku River.

Your real name is Kohaku.

Chihiro, thank you.

My real name is Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

Nigihayami?

Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

What a name! Sounds like a guardian spirit.

I also remember how you fell into me as a child.

You were chasing your shoe.

Yes, you carried me to shallow water, Kohaku.

I'm so grateful...

They're back!

You brought Baby back with you, right?

Baba.

You're not hurt? What a terrible time you had.

Baby, you're standing all by yourself? When...

Yubaba, you promised.

Please return Chihiro's family to the human world.

Not so fast.

This world has rules, you know.

Shut up!

Baba, don't be so mean. Just do it.

Baby had such a good time.

But, a rule's a rule.

Otherwise I can't break the spell.

If you make Sen cry, I won't like you anymore, Baba.

Why that's--

Granny.

Granny?

I'm coming to you.

Haku told me all about the rule.

At least you've got guts.

Here's your contract. Come over here.

I won't be a minute, Baby.

Don't worry.

See if you can guess which of them are yours.

You only get one guess.

Get it right, and you're all free.

Granny, this is no good. My parents aren't here.

Not here? That's your answer?

Yes.

Bingo!

Thatta girl! Right on!

Thank you, everyone.

Go! You win. Just get out of here.

Thank you for everything.

Good bye.

Thank you.

Come and see us.

-Haku... -Let's go.

-Where are Mom and Dad? -They've gone on ahead.

There's no water.

I can't go any farther.

Go back the way you came, Chihiro.

But don't ever look back. Not until you're out of the tunnel.

What about you, Haku?

I'll speak to Yubaba. Quit my apprenticeship.

I'm fine, now that I have my name back.

I'll go back to my world, too.

-Can we meet again? -I'm sure.

-Promise? -Promise.

Now go, and don't look back.

Chihiro.

Where have you been? Hurry up.

Mom! Dad!

You can't just run off like that.

Away we go.

Mom, are you sure you're OK?

What? I'm sure the moving van's there by now.

Hurry along, Chihiro.

Watch your step.

You'll make me trip, Chihiro, clinging like that.

The end of the tunnel.

Hey...

What is it?

Will you look at that...

It's all dusty inside, too.

-Some kind of joke? -You think?

I told you not to stop here.

OK, all clear.

We're off, Chihiro.

Hurry up, Chihiro.

FADE IN:

EXT. HONG KONG -- NIGHT

We're in a HELICOPTER POV flying over Hong Kong's dazzling skyline.

SUPER - HONG KONG - JUNE 30, 1997

FADE UP the sound of a RADIO NEWSCAST as we continue to fly over 
luxury, high rise condos, gleaming corporate headquarters, and
busy freeways.

NEWS ANNOUNCER
(British accent)
...and now, in something less than 
three hours, what was once known as 
the Asian pearl of the British Empire 
will revert forever to The People's 
Republic of China... 

Suddenly, we break out of the lights of the city and FLY LOW over the 
dark harbor. The newscaster's voice blends with the WHUMP WHUMP of the 
chopper.

CUT TO:

INT. A WAREHOUSE-NIGHT

We're CLOSE on a huge gleaming DRAGON made of tin. The dragon seems to 
float effortlessly across a concrete warehouse floor.

PULL BACK until we see that it's riding on a fork lift toward a SHIP 
docked at the warehouse.

As the dragon moves, we see it pass PRICELESS CHINESE ART OBJECTS 
including ceramics, glass paintings, and huge statues.

CHINESE MEN move quickly as they load this precious cargo into the hold 
of the ship.

INT. THE HOLD-NIGHT

The dragon is now descending right on top of us as it's lowered by A 
CRANE. A Chinese man carrying an AUTOMATIC WEAPON looks up at the 
dragon as he walks by. We hold on the dragon.

Suddenly, A MAN'S FACE appears in the dragon's mouth. This is LEE, 
dressed all in black. He dives head first out of the dragon and lands 
silently on the deck.

EXT.THE SHIP-NIGHT

Another GUARD, cradling an M-16, walks around a railing and looks over 
the side. Suddenly, A HAND reaches up and pulls him over the edge. He 
disappears and a beat later we HEAR A SPLASH.

ON ANOTHER GUARD

He's coming up a LADDER, automatic weapon slung over his shoulder. He 
HEARS something, turns on the ladder. Nothing. When he starts back up 
WHACK! A foot kicks him off the ladder and the ship. SPLASH.

ON TWO GUARDS

Lee dispatches them with a FLURRY OF HANDS. SPLASH, SPLASH.

ON THE BOSS

A handsome Chinese man named SANG stands at the railing watching the 
loading process. He SHOUTS in MANDARIN and people jump to his command. 
Then something catches his eye.

CLOSE ON

The top of the warehouse. We see another man's FACE peer over the edge. 
And then disappear again.

ON THE WAREHOUSE

Ten HONG KONG COPS, weapons at the ready, are spread out on the roof 
watching the loading action.

ON SANG

He turns and sees A HELICOPTER in the distance bearing down on the 
boat. Without showing any panic, Sang steps inside his ship office.

He runs to his desk and grabs a REBREATHER MASK from a drawer. He looks 
up suddenly and sees Lee standing in the doorway.

Sang doesn't move a muscle as the two men stare at each other. Suddenly 
AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE erupts everywhere as the raid beings.

Sang dives for a Berretta taped under his desk. He grabs it and starts 
firing. Lee rolls across the office dodging bullets.

Sang runs out and down a flight of steps. Lee follows on his heels.

EXT. THE SHIP-NIGHT

A battle is in full progress as the Cops fire down on the bad guys. The 
helicopter joins the fray. We see a machine gun spray the warehouse 
from the chopper's open door.

INT. THE BOAT-NIGHT

Sang runs down another flight of steps, deeper in the bowels of the 
ship. He stops for an instant and fits the REBREATHER MASK over his 
face. Then he turns and fires four rounds at Lee who has to dive back 
in another passageway.

ON LEE

He comes hurtling down the steps. He stops. We hear nothing except the 
distant sound of GUNFIRE. Then faintly at first, we hear WATER 
SLOSHING.

Lee walks down a dark passageway and stops. He looks down at a round 
HOLE in the deck, just big enough for a man. Dark harbor water SLOSHES 
in the hole.

EXT. DECK-NIGHT

Lee runs up on deck as the battle is ending. Police arrest dozens of 
bad guys. But Lee looks out at the water where one bad guy got away.

CUT TO:

EXT. HAN'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

We're in a LARGE ORIENTAL GARDEN for a black tie dinner. Tuxedos and 
gowns.  An assortment of worldly players. HAN, a handsome charismatic 
man is the focus of attention.  He and his wife CHI-YING are at one of 
the tables.

THOMAS GRIFFIN, 50, British, but warm and personable, has the floor.  
He is at Han's table, holding up a glass of bubbly.

GRIFFIN 
-- because in my heart, I look upon it 
as a tragedy. Yes, ladies and 
gentlemen, a tragedy.
(to Han)
Forgive me, my friend. But I believe 
Hong Kong cannot afford to lose men of 
your character. It's understandable 
that China has envisioned a new role 
for you in the United States. But 
those of us here in law enforcement, 
can only look upon your leave-taking 
with sadness. And speaking personally, 
I will sorely miss your unbridled 
support of British Hong Kong Police.   

So, for all us Brits who ever carried 
a shield in Hong Kong...
(lifts his glass)
We will miss you, but we wish you 
nothing but happiness in America.

The glasses clink.  Lee, now dressed in a tuxedo, suddenly appears at 
Han's side. He whispers something in his ear. Han stands, glass in 
hand.

HAN
(to Griffin)
Tom, thank you. Very much.
(to the group)
I am pleased to be able to leave you 
and Hong Kong with a gift tonight: 
less than an hour ago, Detective Lee 
and his special task force have once 
and for all crushed the Juntao 
Criminal Organization. 

Shock and then applause all around the table.

HAN (cont'd)
This is the kind of legacy I have 
dreamed about: to leave this city 
safer than I found it. To Hong 
Kong...forever.

Everyone drinks.

ON LEE

He's walking back up to the house when he senses someone behind him.  
He turns and receives a fist to the stomach.

SOON YOUNG, Han's daughter is pissed.

SOON YOUNG 
When were you going to tell me you 
were not going with us?

LEE 
I still have work to do here.

SOON YOUNG 
I don't believe you.  My father was 
explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is 
how I found out.

LEE 
I was trying to find the right time.

SOON YOUNG 
After I left?

And she throws another punch at him.  But he catches her hand.  And 
holds it tightly, to keep from being hit again.

LEE 
I am going to miss you very much, Soon 
Young. If I ever have a daughter, I 
hope she is like you.

Soon Young yanks her hand away from him.  She glares at 
him for a moment, then --

SOON YOUNG 
I will not have friends in America.

LEE 
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will 
have many friends very soon.  You will 
see.  America is a very friendly 
place.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. A DINER-NIGHT

We're somewhere in DOWNEY, CALIFORNIA looking at a VINTAGE DINER with a 
lot of glass windows all the way around it.

We see two women seated in a booth, looking out at us.

INT. THE DINER-NIGHT

One woman is SHIRLEY JOHNSON, beautiful, poised, generally not nervous 
like she is now. The other woman, LOIS, is in her early 20's, nasty 
looking, dangerous, and strung out.

Both women are looking out into the parking lot. After a beat, Johnson 
gets up.

JOHNSON
I gotta pee.

She walks away. Lois watches her closely.

EXT. THE DINER PARKING LOT-NIGHT

We're on JAMES CARTER mid twenties, dressed to impress. It doesn't 
appear to be working, however, because he has a GUN to his head.

MAN'S VOICE 
You don't move, you understand?!  You 
don't move!

CARTER 
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What 
you're seeing here?  This is not 
movement. This is my "still".

The man who is holding the gun is HENRY LAFONTAINE, thirty, shaved 
head, expensive clothes.

Lafontaine pushes Carter until he's leaning forward on a parked JAGUAR. 
He starts patting Carter down.  With his feet spread apart, hands 
spread on the trunk, Carter looks like a suspect who is being arrested.

Lafontaine starts feeling around Carter's legs, moving higher up.

CARTER 
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, 
I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, 
mother... 

LAFONTAINE
(interrupting)
Shut up!

CARTER 
You a cop or something?

LAFONTAINE
Or somethin'.

Lafontaine backs off, pulling the gun away from Carter's head.

LAFONTAINE
Okay.

Carter straightens himself.

CARTER 
This is not a good way to start a 
relationship, stickin' a gun to a 
man's head, feelin' around his  
personal equipment.  Make him think 
you don't trust him. 

LAFONTAINE
I don't trust anybody.  Especially 
first time deals.

CARTER 
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure 
you're not a cop.

LAFONTAINE
Nobody touches me.

CARTER 
Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my 
hands on you.  That does nothin' for 
me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no 
ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know 
you're not a cop?

Lafontaine opens the trunk of the JAGUAR.

Inside are MANY SMALL WRAPPED PACKAGES with U.S. ARMY stenciled on 
them.

LAFONTAINE
Because cops don't have the U.S. 
Government's finest...at my prices.

Carter looks at the merchandise.

CARTER
Ooooh. That's pretty.

CUT TO:

INT. DINER BATHROOM-NIGHT

JOHNSON is sitting in a stall, headphones on, talking into a 
transmitter.

JOHNSON
OK, Carter, gimme something here. 
Start with the color of the packaging.

ON CARTER

He sticks a pinky in one ear and scratches.

INSERT

A TINY MICROPHONE is in Carter's ear.

CARTER
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call 
that paper there? Kind of a...Robin 
egg blue color?

ON JOHNSON

JOHNSON
(into the mike)
Good. That's standard military 
packaging for plastique. Get a look 
under it.

ON CARTER

He leans over the packages and slits one open.

CARTER
You know something? Every time I see 
this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a 
double latte grande...
(still looking)
With two shots of non-fat milk.

LAFONTAINE
What are you talking about?

ON JOHNSON

JOHNSON
(into the mike)
That's it. High intensity C-4. We got 
his ass. 

CLICK. Carter looks up at a cute little silver plated .38 that Lois is 
pointing down on her from the next stall.

LOIS
Step out slowly. Or I'll blow your 
hair style into the toilet. Where it 
belongs. 

ON CARTER

He sees a wire coming out of one side of the package.

CARTER
(speaking loudly)
What's this little green wire coming 
out one side of the package?

LAFONTAINE
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

Lafontaine pulls a remote DETONATOR out of his pocket.

LAFONTAINE
I get the money, you get the 
detonator.
(smiles)
First date's are always scary.

Lafontaine shuts the trunk.  Hands the keys to Carter.

HESS 
You cross the street, leave the money 
on the sidewalk.  I'll leave the 
detonator on my side.  Then we trade 
places.  Get the picture?

LOIS VO
Hey, honey...

Lafontaine turns to see Johnson, who's wearing a sexy short skirt, 
walking toward them with Lois bringing up the rear.

LOIS 
She talks to herself on the potty.

Lois shoves Johnson ahead, revealing the GUN in one hand and Johnson's 
TRANSMITTER in the other.

LOIS (cont'd)
(to Lafontaine )
Let's kill her.
(cocking the .38)
I'll flip you for it.  

Lafontaine turns to Carter, but Carter is already throwing a punch.  
Connecting.  Lafontaine falls.

The remote drops as Lois FIRES at Carter.

The bullet ricochets off the car.  Lafontaine sees the remote, makes a 
dive for it.  But another hand gets there first.

Lois turns the gun on Johnson.

CARTER 
No!

Carter is holding the detonator.  Stand-off.

Carter grabs Lafontaine.  Pulls him up.  Lois grabs Johnson, pulls her 
back by her hair, shoves the gun to her head.  She's going to shoot 
anyway.

LAFONTAINE 
Lois, don't!

Lois has the look of a child who hates to be told she can't do 
something.  Johnson looks at Carter.  She offers the best I'm sorry she 
can muster with her eyes.

CARTER 
Put the gun down.

LOIS 
After you're dead.  I promise.

Carter tightens his grip around Lafontaine's throat.

CARTER 
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade.  
You cross the street, leave her on the 
sidewalk.  I will leave him on this 
side.  Then we trade places.  You get 
him, I get her.  Get the picture, 
Lois?

LAFONTAINE
(to Lois)
Do it!

EXT. DOWNEY BLVD-- NIGHT

Lois leads Johnson across the street.  Gun to her side. When she gets 
to the sidewalk, she turns, looks back at Carter.  He's on the opposite 
side, holding Lafontaine.

Lois starts back across the street.  Dodging traffic. And Carter does 
the same, detonator in hand.  Carter and Lois cross toward each other.  
HORNS HONK.  But getting hit by a car is the least of their worries.

They stare at each other as they cross traffic.  Lois wants to kill 
Carter.  She's got that look.  Johnson and Lafontaine wait on opposite 
sides.  Then as Carter and Lois are almost opposite each other --

LAFONTAINE 
Kill him!

Lafontaine starts running.  Carter moves.

Lois starts shooting.  Hitting cars, smashing windshields.  Cars careen 
into each other.  Carter jumps over one, almost hit by another.

Lois is in the middle of the street, firing at Carter.

Another windshield hit.  Car swerving.  Carter falls, the detonator 
skidding away.  Across the lane.

Carter is in direct line of fire.  And she takes aim as a TRUCK RUNS 
OVER THE DETONATOR.

AN EXPLOSION roars in the parking lot. The Jaguar and SIX OTHER CARS go 
up in a ball of fire. Lois is knocked into the street.

The diner windows ALL BLOW OUT AT ONCE.

Carter SEES Lafontaine running for a car stopped on the street.  
Lafontaine pulls open the door, grabs the driver.  Then Lafontaine 
looks up and SEES --

Carter APPEARING THROUGH THE SMOKE.  Running toward him.

Lafontaine drops the driver, swings at Carter, but Carter tackles  him, 
slamming him into the car.  Lafontaine tries to throw a punch.  But 
Carter spins him around and shoves him into the car window, head first.  
Window shattering.

Lafontaine is out.  Carter pulls him out of the car. Lafontaine slumps.  
Carter kneels next to him, pulling out his identification.

CARTER 
Los Angeles Police.  You are under 
arrest.  Anything you say may be used 
to put your ass in jail, you piece of 
shit.

Carter sits down next to Lafontaine.  He's tired and hurting.

Johnson runs up, gun in hand.

JOHNSON 
You okay?

Johnson kneels down next to him.  Her short skirt hikes up her legs.  
Carter looks at one of her thighs.

CARTER 
Not anymore.

JOHNSON 
Where'd you get it? 

Carter looks at Johnson and points to his heart. She suddenly looks 
pissed.

JOHNSON (cont'd)
Oh, give it up!

CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE CONSULATE RESIDENCE -- MORNING

A large entrance to the Ambassador's Residence.  Han is waiting by the 
door, briefcase in hand, as Soon Young sweeps down the grand stairway, 
backpack over one shoulder, lunch bag in hand.  She stops at the bottom 
of the stairs.

SOON YOUNG 
I forgot --
(races back upstairs)
-- something.

Han starts to protest, but... what's the use?  He looks at his watch.  
Then up at Chi-Ying as she comes down the stairs.

HAN 
Will somebody please tell our daughter 
that I am the Ambassador?

Chi-Ying just shrugs.  Nothing can be done about it.

EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE RESIDENCE, LOS ANGELES -- DAY

ESTABLISHING.  FLAG of PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA hanging from a 
standard.  A MERCEDES waiting in front.  DRIVER and BODY GUARD with the 
car.

Han and Soon Young finally appear.  Heading for the car. Soon Young 
gets into the back seat.  And just as Han is about to get in next to 
her, Chi-Ying comes out after him.

CHI-YING 
Telephone.  China.

The Ambassador holds up his hands in exasperation. What's a guy to do?  
He turns to the driver.

HAN 
Drop her off, then come back.
(to Body Guard)
Go with them.
(to Soon Young)
I love you.

Han kisses Soon Young on the cheek, then gets out of the car and rushes 
back into the house.  Chi-Ying waves to Soon Young as the car pulls out 
of the driveway.

INT. CHINESE CONSULATE RESIDENCE -- MORNING

Han puts down his briefcase, picks up the phone.

HAN 
(into phone; in Chinese)
This is Han... 
(in English)
Hello? Hello?

Nothing. Han replaces the phone with a troubled expression.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREETS OF BEVERLY HILLS -- MORNING

The MERCEDES makes its way down tree-lined streets. Houses, cars, very 
few people -- this is a very affluent neighborhood.

It turns onto a bridge leading down into the Beverly Hills FLATS.  A 
WELCOME TO THE CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS sign flashes past.

INT. MERCEDES/REAR SEAT -- CONTINUOUS

Soon Young leans forward and inserts a CD into the deck. As the music 
comes on she flips the dial to maximum -- total chaos.  The sounds of 
R&B/HIP HOP fill the car.

FRONT SEAT

The Bodyguard and driver look at one another -- what is that racket?  
The bodyguard turns around and reaches through the partition lowering 
the volume.

Soon Young turns the music back up.  The bodyguard reaches through and 
turns it down again.

She leans forward, pushing the bodyguard away and turns the music back 
up.  A staring contest.  She slams the privacy glass shut in his face.  
The bodyguard shakes his head turns back around.

EXT. BEVERLY HILLS FLATS -- CONTINUOUS

The Mercedes turns onto Wilshire Boulevard where cars are backed up at 
least two blocks.  Farther ahead, a PIGGY BACK OIL TRUCK has jack 
knifed and turned over, blocking traffic in both directions. Cops mill 
around trying to create order out of chaos.

INT. MERCEDES/FRONT SEAT -- CONTINUOUS

The driver checks the rearview:  Too late, more cars stacking behind 
him.  Up ahead an ASIAN traffic cop diverts cars onto Dayton Way.  The 
driver nudges the bodyguard, points at the wreck.

DRIVER
(in Mandarin)
LA drivers.

The car inches onto Dayton Way.

A SECOND TRAFFIC COP directs them onto Rodeo.  As the Mercedes pulls 
alongside him, the bodyguard notices he's Asian too.

EXT. RODEO DRIVE -- CONTINUOUS

A DELIVERY VAN waits as the Mercedes stops at the corner. The passenger 
door opens and an Asian MAN slides out, traffic cop uniform, white 
gloves, glasses, hat pulled low.

INT. REAR SEAT -- CONTINUOUS

Soon Young barely pays attention as she watches the cop knock on the 
bodyguard's window.

EXT. MERCEDES -- CONTINUOUS

The bodyguard cautiously lowers the glass.

BODYGUARD
Yes, officer?

The Cop leans in as if to speak,

BOOM!

Blows him away.  The bodyguard slumps forward.  BOOM! The driver gets 
it. We see now the cop is SANG.

IN THE REAR

Soon Young is shocked but she thinks fast, scoots across the seat as 
Sang jerks the door open.  She flies out the other door, he manages to 
get a handful of backpack, she quickly wriggles free, slams the door 
shut behind her and starts running.

EXT. MERCEDES/STREET

She turns around, sees Sang making his way OVER the car. She runs 
through traffic towards a shopping structure, 2 Rodeo Dr.

Sang curses when he sees he can't reach her and heads back to the van.

EXT. STREET/2 RODEO DRIVE -- CONTINUOUS

Soon Young runs around the corner breathing hard.  She hugs the edge of 
the building.  Peeks back around.  Sees a van making a sharp U-turn, 
headed her way.  She starts across the cobblestones.  BEHIND HER, a 
MOTORCYCLE pulls out.  She's in the middle of the street.

VAROOM!

The biker scoops her up under his left arm, pulls onto Rodeo.

THE DELIVERY VAN

Screeches up.

ON SANG

He jumps out and opens the back of the van. Soon Young takes a SWING AT 
HIM. Sang grabs her arm easily and then viciously PUNCHES HER, sending 
her flying back into the van.

Sang slams the doors.  Trots to the front.  They pull out.

LITTLE SANTA MONICA --

the van and motorcycle head off in separate directions.

CUT TO:

EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE COMPOUND -- DAY

UNMARKED CARS roar down the road, racing up to the residence. TWO CARS 
stay on the street outside.

SEVERAL MEN IN SUITS get out, head for the residence. Some lugging 
equipment.  In the lead is AGENT IN CHARGE, WARREN RUSS.  The door 
opens, they enter.

INT. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - DAY

Ambassador Han greets them.  He has obviously been through great 
strain, but maintains his composure.

RUSS 
Ambassador, I'm Warren Russ, FBI Agent 
in Charge.  This is Agent Whitney.

DAN WHITNEY, thirty-eight, ex-football type, solid American, shakes 
hands with the Ambassador.

RUSS (cont'd)
I know this is a difficult time but...

HAN 
(interrupting)
You can set up in my office.

INT. OFFICE -- DAY

Office off the main entrance.  Elegantly furnished. Chinese Flag.  
Political photographs.  The FBI is already setting up equipment.  
Tapping phone lines.

Han watches them for a moment as his personal life is pushed aside and 
the Feds take over.  Then he approaches Russ.

HAN 
I would like one of my people to help.

RUSS 
Ambassador, let me assure you that the 
FBI has made this a top priority. We 
have plenty of manpower on the case.

HAN 
He is very good.

RUSS 
As I said, sir, we've got all the 
people we need.

Russ turns away.

HAN 
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My 
daughter is not an American.

RUSS
I understand, sir. But you are an 
honored guest of the United States...

HAN 
(interrupting)
He is already on the plane.  I hope 
you will treat him with the same 
respect you have shown me.

Russ stares at Han, not sure how to handle this situation.  Mr. Han 
bows and exits.  Leaving Russ at a loss.  Whitney comes up behind him.

WHITNEY 
What was that all about?

RUSS 
He wants his own man.

WHITNEY
What?!

CUT TO:

EXT. LAPD-DAY

The entrance is UNDERGROUND and very busy. Carter and Johnson pull up 
in the sedan.

INT. DETECTIVE DIVISION ROOM - L.A.P.D. -- DAY

Overloaded DETECTIVES at desks.  Trying to solve too many crimes in a 
city with too many bad people.  Din of PHONES, KEYBOARDS, VOICES.

A pissed off Johnson enters in front of Carter.

CARTER
You're killin' me here.

JOHNSON 
Carter, just because you saved my 
butt, doesn't mean it's yours.

CARTER 
Oh, baby, you cruel...

Johnson enters a small office right across from Carter's desk where he 
now plops down.

TWO DETECTIVES walk up.

FIRST DETECTIVE 
Heard about what happened over there 
at the diner.  Nice work.

SECOND DETECTIVE 
(laughing)
Not everybody gets to blow up a city 
block.

FIRST DETECTIVE 
Don't worry about it.  Nobody liked 
the food there anyway.

SECOND DETECTIVE 
Probably give you a medal.  For urban 
renewal.

Both Detectives slap hands and laugh.

CARTER 
That's good. What did you two do? Work 
that up in the men's room while you 
were playing with each other?

The cops stop laughing. They walk away when Carter's phone rings.

CARTER
Carter... Yeah... uh-huh...now?  Okay.

He hangs up and looks at Johnson in her office.

CARTER (cont'd)
Captain wants to see me.

JOHNSON 
(melting)
Last night's as much my fault as 
yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on 
anybody --

CARTER 
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is 
why I get the big bucks.

Carter gets up and crosses toward the CAPTAIN'S OFFICE in the corner of 
the room.  A brave man facing the Lion's den.  Even Johnson can't help 
but admire his courage.

INT. CAPT. DIEL'S OFFICE -- DAY

WILLIAM DIEL is behind his desk.  Diel is fifty, professional, doesn't 
smile a lot.  He's not smiling now. Carter enters.

DIEL 
I don't know what went wrong last 
night, but this department could've 
lost one detective and our only 
explosives expert.

CARTER 
Sir, I can explain.

DIEL 
What you did was dangerous and 
completely outside policy.

CARTER 
I know, but --

DIEL 
That's probably the only reason 
Johnson's still alive.

This takes Carter a little by surprise.

DIEL 
Good job.

CARTER 
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to 
preserve Johnson's ass. 
(pause)
Well...you know what I mean. 

DIEL 
I got a call from the F.B.I.  The 
daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has 
been kidnapped and they asked for 
help. You're it.

Carter straightens his posture a bit.

CARTER 
Feds asked for me?

DIEL 
They asked for the best street man I 
had.

Carter tries to be humble, but... damn, that's hard.

CARTER 
And that, of course, would be me.

DIEL 
Don't push it. You better watch your 
ass with these Fed types. If there's a 
screw-up, they won't think twice about 
burnin' it.

INT. DETECTIVE DIVISION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Carter exits Diel's office, crosses back through the desks to his own.  
A lot of eyes on him.

Johnson comes out of her office.

JOHNSON 
What happened?

Carter just packs up his stuff.

JOHNSON 
Did he fire you?  He can't fire you!

Carter puts a hand on her shoulder.

CARTER 
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just 
reassigned me to the Feds.  

JOHNSON 
The Feds?!

CARTER 
FBI needs a taste of the street. 
And I'm it.

Carter returns to packing up his stuff.

CARTER 
Way he put it, I was the only one he 
thought could handle it. But you know 
what the worst thing is? 

JOHNSON
(caught up in it)
No...what?

CARTER
I could get promoted right out of 
here.

JOHNSON
What's wrong with that?

CARTER
I wouldn't be close to you. 
(sniffing)
What is that perfume, girl?

Johnson comes back to reality.

JOHNSON 
No matter how many times you go 
undercover, you still come out an 
asshole. 

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET -- DAY

Unmarked car pulls up in front of the Chinese Consulate. Carter sticks 
his badge out the window to FBI Agents. Carter is wearing shades.  
Playing it cool.

CARTER 
Detective James Carter.  L.A.P.Deee.

One of the Agents relays the information via his radio. Then they open 
the gates.  Carter drives in.

INT. CHINESE CONSULATE RESIDENCE -- DAY

Carter enters.  The place is under FBI control.  But everything's gonna 
be okay now.  Carter's here.  Carter is the only one not in a dark 
suit.

Interviews of all staff being conducted in one room - we get a glimpse 
as a door opens and an AGENT with an EAR PLUG exits.  Carter gives the 
Agent a knowing nod.

CARTER 
(re: ear plug)
Oh yeah, gotta get me one a those.

Sees ANOTHER FBI AGENT with a high-powered rifle move past.

CARTER
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.

WHITNEY 
Carter.

Carter sees Whitney motioning him into the office.

INT. HAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

Carter enters.  Lots of activity.  All electronic equipment is up and 
running.  AGENTS are testing the PHONE TAPE.

Russ is on the phone as Carter walks up.

RUSS 
(into phone)
...yes, sir, I understand. I'll do my 
best...but there is a question of 
authority, sir... yes, sir, okay.

Russ hangs up.  Turns to Carter.  Carter nods.  Confident that Russ 
knows he's the man for the job.

RUSS 
Carter.  I'm Russ.  Agent in charge.

Carter eyes him.  The suit, the hair, the shine on the shoes.  Russ 
holds out his hand.  They shake.

CARTER 
Any demands yet?

RUSS 
At this point we don't have much.  

CARTER 
How much they want?

RUSS 
(ignoring him)
You come highly recommended, Carter.  
And your particular assignment 
requires a special talent.

CARTER 
Interrogation is one a my specialties, 
but undercover work is my forte.

Everything about Carter changes; posture, language, attitude, as he 
morphs into a gang drug supplier.

CARTER 
Yo, bro, y'cruisin' fo da go-dee on da 
hi, u be comin' to da ri-man, say 
what.  [or something to this effect]

Russ stares at Carter for a moment.  Carter quickly changes back to 
himself.

CARTER 
Never knew I was a man in blue.

EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE RESIDENCE -- DAY

Russ and Carter exit.

RUSS 
... the director considers this top 
priority, considering he is a Chinese 
National and here under difficult 
circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And 
he is to be shown every courtesy. 
Within reason.

CARTER 
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way.  
If I'm gonna handle this situation...

RUSS 
(interrupting)
He is the situation.

Carter stops walking.

CARTER 
I'm talking about the girl.

RUSS 
Don't worry about the kidnapping, 
Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that.  
Your assignment is Lee.

Carter hesitates a moment, trying to sort this thing out.  

CARTER
What kind of assignment is that?

RUSS
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung 
King Cop getting his head blown off 
and turning this operation into a 
international incident. 

CARTER 
(getting hot)
Why don't you assign one of your own 
men to this?

RUSS 
Because with your special talents, I'm 
sure you'll do a better job. 

CARTER
What the hell am I supposed to do with 
him? Take him to the zoo?

RUSS
Just make him think you're following 
leads.  Interview some suspects, look 
at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I 
don't care.  I just don't want to see 
him- or you, for that matter- until 
this is resolved.
(hands Carter a file)
Now, we want to make a good 
impression, don't we?  His plane lands 
in an hour. Don't be late. 

End of conversation.  Russ returns to the house.  Carter sizzles.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- DAY

Carter's unmarked car pulls into one of the POLICE ZONES.

INT. CARTERS UNMARKED CAR - PARKED -- CONTINUOUS

Carter looks at his watch.  His mobile phone rings.

CARTER 
Yeah.

INTERCUT WITH JOHNSON 

She's at her desk.

JOHNSON 
So how'd it go?

Carter perks up when he hears Johnson's voice.

CARTER 
How'd what go?

JOHNSON 
With the FBI. What do you think I'm 
talking about?

Carter puts on some exuberance.

CARTER 
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they 
put me in charge of.  They sent for 
the Ambassador's personal Chinese 
Investigator type.  He is like the 
baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, 
let me repeat that, I am the man who 
is on the case with him.  Just the two 
of us, alone, workin' the whole deal 
as a team.

JOHNSON 
They put you in charge?

CARTER 
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No 
interference.  They don't even want to 
hear from us until we're done.  I love 
the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.

JOHNSON 
Well...listen, if you need any help, 
you know, back up, call me, OK? 

CARTER
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. 
You can count on it.

JOHNSON
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be 
careful.

That takes a little of the wind out of Carter's sails. We can see it in 
his face, but he tries his best not to let her hear it over the phone.

CARTER 
Yeah, thanks.

He hangs up and mutters to himself.

CARTER (cont'd)
Yeah, gotta be careful.  Might get run 
over by a Sky Cap.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAX -- AFTERNOON

The CHINESE AIRLINES JET lands.

INT. LAX TERMINAL -- AFTERNOON

Carter is waiting at the GATE, the only one who could bypass Customs.  
He's watching a parade of ASIAN PASSENGERS deplane, heading for 
Customs.

CARTER 
Mr. Lee.  Is there a Mr. Lee on the 
plane?
(no response)
Does anybody know Mr. Lee?
(no response)
Mr. Lee from China.

Carter is losing his patience.  Passengers continue to deplane.  But 
their ranks are thinning.

CARTER 
Mr. Lee.

Finally the last of the last.  An ELDERLY ASIAN MAN AND WOMAN.

CARTER 
Mr. and Mrs. Lee?

They look at him, smile, but continue past.

CARTER 
I don't believe this!  First I get 
stuck with this --

LEE moves down the ramp and stops as he HEARS CARTER'S VOICE --

CARTER'S VOICE 
-- lame ass assignment, now the 
sonuvabitch doesn't even show up.  
This is bullshit!  Ain't my fault if 
this limpdick can't make his plane.

Carter is about to leave when Lee exits the ramp. Looking at Carter.  
And Carter looks at him.

CARTER 
Mr. Lee?

Lee smiles and bows politely.

CARTER 
You got bags?

No response from Lee. Carter assumes he can't speak English.

CARTER (cont'd)
Oh shit, you gotta be kiddin'.

Carter holds out his FBI IDENTIFICATION.

CARTER 
You speaky Eng-lish?

Lee looks at Carter for a moment, then smiles and nods.

CARTER 
Yeah, right, sure, uh-huh.

CUT TO:

INT. CAR -- AFTERNOON

Unmarked FBI sedan.  Carter drives.  Lee is looking out the window.  
This is his first time to America.  And despite the reason, he can't 
help but look.

CARTER 
First thing I gotta do is check you 
in.  So we have to go to L.A.P.D. H.Q.
(checking Lee )
You understand what I'm saying?

A beat, then Lee says:

LEE
(slowly)
You talk very fast.

CARTER 
Okay, I'll slow down.
(just as fast)
So we go downtown and we ask you a few 
questions... you know, like what's 
your name?  How old are you?  You ever 
expose yourself in public...shit like 
that.

Carter waits to see if he's getting through.  Lee just nods.  Carter is 
convinced he's just talking to himself.

CARTER 
Yeah, good, we also will ask if you 
have ever worn pink frilly 
underwear...and what the hell is the 
attraction of Karaoke to Asian 
Peoples?

Lee nods as if he understands everything.  Carter sighs. It's gonna be 
a long assignment.  Lee points to the RADIO.

CARTER 
You want the radio?  RAY-DEE-OHHH.

Lee nods.

CARTER 
Why not? Beats talking shit to myself.

Lee smiles, nods.  Carter turns on the radio.  A BEACH BOYS SONG comes 
on.

CARTER 
Oh no...

Carter reaches for the radio, but Lee holds out his hand.

LEE 
Beach Boy.

CARTER 
You're shittin' me.  You know the 
Beach Boys?!

LEE 
Beach Boy America.
(starts singing)
Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of 
my --

Carter listens to Lee sing along for a moment, then --

CARTER
Beach Boy America my ass.  You don't 
look like a Beach Boy, you don't sound 
like a Beach Boy.  And your singin' 
ability is only gonna make me do 
something that I could get the death 
penalty for.  You want America, here's 
America.

Carter changes the station.  RAP MUSIC.  Carter drums along with the 
bass line.  Moving his body to the beat, to make sure he shows the 
effect of the rhythm.

CARTER 
Tell me you can do this to the Beach 
Boys.

Lee listens, trying hard to get it. He doesn't. He pushes the other 
button back to HELP ME RHONDA.

LEE 
(smiles)
Help me Rhonda.

CARTER 
(incensed)
Let me give you a piece of advice: 
never touch another man's radio. You 
do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not 
Yolanda, gonna save your ass.

Carter pushes the button back to Rap.

CARTER 
That is America, got it?  That is 
America.

CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE CONSULATE - HAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

Han is reviewing PHOTOGRAPHS with Whitney and Russ.

RUSS 
-- operating out of San Francisco, has 
been associated with one of the 
Triads.  This group was identified as 
having entered the United States two 
months ago --

The PHONE RINGS.  Attention turns to the desk.  Russ stands.

RUSS 
This could be it.
(to Han)
Remember: try and keep him on the 
phone as long as you can.  Ask to 
speak with your daughter.  Ask how she 
is... anything.

They cross to the desk.  Han hesitates.  Nervous.  FOURTH RING.  He 
picks up the phone.

HAN 
Hello.

MAN'S VOICE 
Han?

HAN 
Yes.

MAN'S VOICE 
It's Griffin.

HAN 
Griffin?  Where are you.

Han turns to Russ.  Russ mouths ³Do you know him?² Han nods.

GRIFFIN 
Still in Hong Kong. But I'm afraid 
this is not a social call.  I have 
just learned some disturbing 
information.  There is going to be an 
attempt to kidnap you or a member of 
your family.  I don't know when.  And 
I'm not sure by whom.  But I trust my 
sources.  You should contact the 
F.B.I. immediately.  They'll know what 
to do.

HAN 
I am afraid your source was very good. 
They have Soon-Young.

GRIFFIN 
Oh God, no. I'm so sorry, my friend.

Russ picks up the phone.

RUSS 
This is Special Agent Russ, Federal 
Bureau of Investigation.  Would you 
please identify yourself?

INT. HONG KONG APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Overlooking downtown Hong Kong.  Griffin is next to the window, phone 
in hand, looking out at the lights of the city.

GRIFFIN 
Yes, of course.  My name is Thomas Ian 
Griffin, former commander of British 
Hong Kong police.  The Ambassador and 
I are old and close friends.  He will 
confirm this.  But the information I 
have just relayed to you is sensitive.  
I'm sure you understand that I cannot 
provide details over a telephone.  But 
in lieu of Soon Young's...situation, 
I'll be on the next flight to Los 
Angeles.

CUT TO:

INT. L.A.P.D. BUILDING -- AFTERNOON

Carter leads Lee toward the FRONT DESK.  Holds up ID and motions to 
Lee.

CARTER 
He's with me.

Lee looks at the OFFICER, offering a short bow and a polite smile.  The 
Officer isn't used to such polite behavior.  Can't help a smile back.

Carter sees the exchange.  Makes him wanna puke.  He leads Lee to the 
ELEVATOR.  They get in.

INT. ELEVATOR -- AFTERNOON

Carter and Lee enter.  Doors close.  They're alone.

CARTER 
You carry a gun?

Lee looks at Carter as if questioning.  Carter has no patience.

CARTER 
A gun, a gun!

Carter reaches for his weapon, but suddenly Lee's hands move with 
lightening speed - and Carter is suddenly staring at HIS OWN GUN IN 
LEE'S HANDS.

CARTER 
What're you doing?!  I wasn't gonna 
shoot you!  I was trying to explain -- 
ah shit, give me the god damn gun.

Lee hesitates, then smiles and gives the gun back. Carter fumes.  Holds 
up his gun.

CARTER 
You have one of these?

LEE 
No.

CARTER 
(holstering the gun)
Yeah, well you're in American now.  
Everybody's got guns.  That tricky 
shit with your hands is gonna get your 
ass shot to hell.

Lee smiles.  Carter turns away.  They ride in silence. Suddenly Carter 
goes for his gun again.

And Lee's hands fly into action.  And once again -- Carter is staring 
at HIS OWN GUN IN LEE'S HANDS.  Now Carter is really pissed.  But Lee 
smiles and hands the gun back.

Carter forces a smile.  Takes the gun.

CARTER 
You try that shit on me one more time, 
I'll kick your ass.  You understand 
that?  You know what kick your ass 
means?

Lee smiles, nods.

CARTER 
I'll bet you do.

The ELEVATOR STOPS.  Doors open.  Carter motions politely for Lee to 
exit first and which direction to go.

INT. HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON

Lee exits.  Carter comes out behind him.  Takes a couple of steps.  
Passing OTHER DETECTIVES getting onto the elevators.  Carter follows 
Lee, a step behind.  Then he goes for his gun again.

Lee, as if he has eyes in the back of his head, spins, kicks.

And Carter is on his back, staring at the ceiling. Looking at his gun 
in Lee's hands.  Lee holds out his hand to help Carter up.  Suddenly we 
HEAR --

MAN'S VOICE 
Put the gun down now!

Carter and Lee turn.  A DETECTIVE has his gun leveled at Lee from ten 
feet away - obviously mistaking the situation.

THE DETECTIVE 
Put it down!

CARTER 
It's alright.  He's with me.

THE DETECTIVE 
With you?  He's pointing a goddamn gun 
at you.  You call that with you?

And now it's Lee's turn to speak - in perfect English.

LEE 
He was just showing me how to take a 
gun away from a suspect.

Carter looks at Lee in disbelief.  Lee flips the gun around and hands 
it back to Carter, butt first.  Carter takes the gun, anger building.  
Then Lee grabs Carter by the hand and pulls him off the floor.

THE DETECTIVE 
You must be a helluva teacher.

LEE 
Oh yes, he's very good.

THE DETECTIVE 
(to Carter)
Just don't do that shit in the 
hallway. I could've killed him.

CARTER 
Oh yeah, maybe next time you will.

Lee smiles at the Detective and bows as they move past. The Detective 
can't help but return the smile.  Carter is pissed.

INT. MEN'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Carter bursts into the men's room. Lee follows him in.

CARTER 
You speak English!

LEE 
A little.

CARTER 
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.

LEE 
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I 
didn't.

CARTER 
It's the same thing!

LEE
I am not responsible for your 
assumptions.

CARTER 
You're full of shit.  Do you 
understand what I'm saying to you?  
Full of shit? 

LEE 
Not being able to speak is not the 
same as not speaking.  You seemed as 
if you liked to talk.  I like to let 
people talk who like to talk.  It 
makes it easier to find out how full 
of shit they are.

CARTER 
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm 
full a shit.

LEE 
(smiles)
We are both full of shit.

CARTER 
Yeah, that's right.  Now that we 
understand each other... show me how 
you did that.

Carter pantomimes Lee's fast hands.  Whipping them around in a frenzy 
of activity.  Lee just watches Carter's pathetic attempt to mimic him 
for a moment, then:

LEE
You should keep your gun.

CUT TO:

INT. AT CARTER'S DESK -- AFTERNOON

Carter is sitting on one side, Lee on the other.  Carter is handing him 
a bunch of brochures and information.

CARTER 
... and there's a copy of our 
insurance packages.

Carter hands another folder to Lee.  Lee stares at the material.  But 
it's obvious he's losing patience himself.

LEE 
I am afraid I don't understand the 
importance of this information.

CARTER 
Look, you want to work in this 
country, you gotta know this crap.  
Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep 
shit here.  Working the danger zone.  
And you need insurance.  Cause, you 
know, you might be starting some riots 
and shit.

But Carter sees Johnson coming toward him.  And he quickly puts on the 
positive.

CARTER 
So, my plan is, we hit the scene, walk 
it --

Lee doesn't know what the hell Carter is talking about. Johnson glances 
at Lee, then Carter.

CARTER 
-- and get the feel for how it went 
down.  Then hit the witnesses --

Carter sees Johnson, smiles, waves.  Lee turns to look, but Carter goes 
quickly back to talking, as if what he has to say is too important to 
interrupt.

CARTER 
-- see who remembers what and how the 
action went down.

Johnson watches for a moment, then she moves past. Realizing the 
conversation is too important to interrupt. But she smiles at Lee.

CARTER 
Because we gotta dig up the --

And Lee smiles at Johnson.

CARTER 
-- what the hell is that?

LEE 
What?

CARTER 
That silly-ass look on your face.

LEE 
I was being polite.

CARTER 
Well don't do that.  Polite don't work 
here.  You do that polite shit here in 
America, they'll sue your ass for 
harassment.

Lee just stares at Carter.  America, according to Carter, is not what 
he expected.  But now that Johnson is safely past:

CARTER 
Where were we?

LEE 
Witnesses.

CARTER 
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be 
hungry, you just flew in from China.  
And what'd they feed you, Chinese 
food, right?  Then you gotta be 
hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm 
hungry.  We'll get some food on the 
way to the Consulate.

CUT TO:

EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE -- AFTERNOON

A HOT DOG STAND out in front.  Carter is handed TWO HOT DOGS by the 
COOK.  Gives one to Lee.

CARTER 
It's not really dog.  Just called a 
dog.  Not like in Vietnam where if 
they made one a these it'd be dog.  
It's just made from... well, I'm not 
sure what, but there ain't no dog in 
it.  

They move down the street and Carter gestures to the wild quasi-Chinese 
architecture of the old Grauman Theatre.

CARTER 
Just like home, huh?  I never been to 
China, but...
(looks at Lee)
... I guess this must be pretty much 
it, huh?  Dragons and shit.

Lee just stares at the garish design.  He is not happy.

LEE 
I thought you were taking me to the 
consulate. 

CARTER 
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And 
you gotta see John Wayne's footprints.    
Everybody does. It's almost like a 
law. You can't believe how small his 
feet were for a dude that big. Tiny 
god damn feet!

Carter leads Lee to the foot prints in cement.

But a BUS LOAD OF ASIAN TOURISTS starts to move in, swirling around.  
Carter looks at the foot prints for a beat, really getting tired of 
this job.  Then he turns to Lee and... is CONFRONTED BY THE BUS LOAD OF 
ASIANS.  Lee is no where to be seen.

CARTER 
Lee?
(no Lee)
Lee!

A COUPLE of the ASIAN TOURISTS turn to him.  Carter starts searching 
through the tourists.  Trying to pick him out.

Lee moves quickly through the Asians, smiling and commenting on the 
concrete memorials, just like he's a tourist.  And Carter can't pick 
him out.

CARTER 
Lee!

Carter suddenly sees him.  His back to us.  Grabs him from behind and 
spins him around.

CARTER 
Hey, I was callin' --

Then he realizes it's not Lee.

CARTER 
Shit!  Where'd he go?!  LEE!

As Carter turns and confronts more ASIAN FACES, we SEE LEE slip past 
him in the b.g.

CARTER 
This ain't funny, man.  I know you're 
in there!

Carter turns, SEES ANOTHER BUS LOAD OF ASIAN PEOPLE unloading.

CARTER 
Oh no, man, no!

Carter pushes through the tourists.  And finally SEES Lee across the 
street, hailing a cab.  Carter can't believe it.

CARTER 
Hey!  What're you doin'?!

Lee turns, sees Carter.  The cab is still too far away to get into.  So 
Lee goes running after it.

CARTER 
Hey!  Hey!

Carter takes off after him.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD -- AFTERNOON

Lee darts right across traffic - gymnastically moving through the flow 
of traffic.  HORNS HONK.  A car skids to a stop, almost hitting him, 
but Lee vaults over it.

Carter sees the maneuver, can't believe it.  Continues after him, 
trying not to get flattened.

CARTER 
Come back here!

Lee grabs onto the back of a MOVING BUS, climbs up on top.

FROM ATOP THE BUS

Lee looks back at Carter.  Carter is pouring on the speed, catching up 
to the bus.  He's going to catch Lee. Lee looks off the side at ANOTHER 
BUS COMING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

CARTER

lunges at the bus, grabbing hold.

CARTER 
Don't do this!  You're gonna get hurt!  
We're going to the Consulate, right 
now, I swear --

Carter climbs up just in time to see --

LEE

-- leap from the bus to the OTHER BUS moving in the opposite direction.  
He lands hard, grabbing hold.

CARTER

He watches in disbelief as Lee is now moving down the street in the 
opposite direction.  Carter starts back down the bus as fast as he can, 
jumping the last four feet, right into the path of a CAR, which swerves 
to avoid hitting him, into the path of ANOTHER CAR.  HORNS HONK.  CARS 
SWERVE.

Carter runs down Hollywood Blvd. toward La Brea as we SEE --

LEE

-- JUMP ONTO THE TOP OF A MOVING VAN which is next to the Bus.  Then 
jumps from the VAN to a GARBAGE TRUCK just making the turn down La 
Brea.  Disappearing around the corner.

EXT. STREET - HOLLYWOOD AND LA BREA-- AFTERNOON

Carter reaches the corner in time to watch the Garbage Truck heading 
toward Sunset Blvd.  But he can't give up. What would he tell Russ?  He 
lost his assignment?

He starts running after the Garbage Truck.  And as Carter runs past 
CAMERA CRANES ACROSS TO ANOTHER DELIVERY TRUCK moving the opposite 
direction.

And ON TOP OF THE DELIVERY TRUCK is Lee, staying low, watching Carter 
run his poor tired ass off in the wrong direction.

Lee looks around quickly.  A YELLOW CAB is moving down the cross 
street.

INT. YELLOW CAB -- AFTERNOON

The DRIVER is cruising when a MAN seems to DROP from the sky right in 
front of him.  The Driver slams on the brakes and skids to a stop at a 
smiling Lee.

CUT TO:

EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE -- NIGHT

The taxi pulls up in front and Lee exits.  Heads for the entrance.  TWO 
FBI AGENTS (WILLIS and GEIGER) watching. One speaks into a HEADPHONE.

FBI AGENT WILLIS

We have a man in a taxi.  License 
plate 2NRB 998. About five ten.

INT. CHINESE CONSULATE - HAN'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Whitney gets the call.  Turns to Russ.  Coffee cups and take out food 
spread around.

WHITNEY 
Got someone dropped off by a cab. 
Asian.

Everyone perks up.

EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS

FBI Agent Geiger stops Lee.

FBI AGENT GEIGER 
Can I help you?

LEE
Help. Yes.  I must see the Ambassador.

FBI AGENT GEIGER 
About what?

LEE 
May I please see him?  It is very 
important.

FBI Agent Willis walks up.

FBI AGENT WILLIS
Why don't you tell us why you need to 
see the Ambassador?  We'll decide if 
it's important.

LEE
It is about his daughter, Soon Young.

That's the magic word.  Things happen fast.

FBI AGENT GEIGER 
Hands on top of your head!

FBI AGENT WILLIS 
(into head set)
He asked about the Ambassador's 
daughter.

FBI Agent Geiger reaches for his gun.  And Lee reacts.

INT. CHINESE CONSULATE - HAN'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

WHITNEY 
He asked about the daughter.

RUSS 
Get Œem!

BACK TO LEE AND THE TWO AGENTS

Both agents are on the ground looking up at Lee who is holding their 
guns.  Wondering what happened.  And sure they are about to die.

FBI AGENT GEIGER 
(into head set)
Code nine, code nine!

The agents are frozen, fear on their faces.  It looks like Lee is going 
to kill them.  But suddenly he throws their guns into the bushes.

LEE 
You just don't understand.  I was 
invited.

Lee moves toward the entrance and SEES SIX MORE AGENTS coming at him.  
Lee can't believe it.  What is going on?!

WHITNEY 
There he is!

Lee darts across the driveway and around the corner of the house.

ON LEE

He runs across a patio. Suddenly, a side door on the house opens and 
TWO AGENTS run into his path. WITHOUT BREAKING STRIDE, he twirls and 
takes one of them out with a kick.

The second throws one punch, two and hits AIR. Lee chops four times and 
the guy ends up in a hedge.

Whitney, Geiger and Williams come around a corner.

The agent lying on the patio points.

PATIO AGENT 
He went up!

They look up at a WALL on the side of the house. Beyond it is the 
Consulate Compound.

AGENT WHITNEY
(into mike)
Secure the area!

EXT. THE COMPOUND-NIGHT

Lee is below the wall, in the bushes, silently making his way into the 
large back yard area.

He hears someone coming. He hops up onto one of the Jacaranda Trees and 
starts climbing.

INT. RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

The Agents run into the house, head for the doors. Whitney runs up the 
stairs.  Other agents behind.

INT. AMBASSADOR'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

The Ambassador is pacing.  Chi-Ying is sitting.  She has been crying.  
The commotion outside finally reaches them. We HEAR MEN YELLING.  The 
door bursts open.  Whitney enters.

WHITNEY 
I'm sorry, sir, we have an 
unauthorized entry.  Please get away 
from the windows! 

CUT TO:

EXT. THE ROOF-NIGHT

Lee crawls along the steeply pitched roof looking for a way in.

He gets to a GABLE with a WINDOW. But before he can look inside, an 
AGENT sticks his head out the window and looks around.

The agent turns to his left. Nothing. He turns to his right and there's 
Lee, smiling at him. POW. Lee connects with a right and the agent 
ACCIDENTALLY FALLS out the window.

Lee freaks and DIVES for the guy as he slides down the roof.

ON TWO AGENTS

They're walking in the back yard, guns drawn. Something makes one of 
them look up.

AGENTS POV

The guy from the window, still out cold, is dangling off the edge of 
the house.

ON LEE

He's out of sight, still on the roof, holding the guy's collar and 
keeping him from falling over the edge. He peaks down at the agents and 
then lets the guy go.

He lands on the two agents like a bomb, knocking both of them down.

Lee jumps off the roof and starts running across the huge lawn.

Three agents come out of the POOL HOUSE and try to cut him off.

Lee KICKS one of them into the pool. He faces off with the other two as 
more agents come across the yard.

Lee swings and kicks his way around the pool. Two more AGENTS get into 
the fray. Lee pops one into the other and pushes both of them into the 
pool.

Suddenly the odds are too great as more agents close in. Lee DIVES into 
the pool and swims under water to the other end.

He comes up in time to PUNCH two of the guys he threw in. Then he jumps 
out of the pool.

Six agents chase him back across the lawn. Lee runs up an outside 
staircase at the back of the house.

He disappears in a door just as one of the agents FIRES.

CUT TO:

INT. THE AMBASSADORS BEDROOM

We HEAR the shot ring out.

WHITNEY 
Down stairs, sir! Now!

Whitney shoves the Ambassador and Chi-Ying out of the bedroom.  Then he 
charges out onto a balcony, gun drawn.

CUT TO:

INT. AN UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Lee comes down the hall, dripping wet. He moves quickly and quietly. He 
passes a doorway and immediately RUSS comes out the door, behind Lee, 
quietly getting ready to pounce.

Ahead of Lee, Whitney comes out of the bedroom gun drawn.

Suddenly, Lee takes out Russ behind him with an elbow and does his 
quick hands routine with Whitney's pistol. Both Whitney and Russ end up 
on their backs.

CUT TO:

INT. THE FOYER-DAY

Han and His wife are surrounded by agents in the large open foyer below 
the staircase. Suddenly, Lee drops down from the stairway above and 
lands right in front of Han.

SIX FBI PISTOLS all point at Lee.

HAN 
Lee?

LEE 
Sorry I'm late, sir.

Lee bows, offers a smile of regret. Then he looks down at his feet 
where he's now dripping water.

Russ and Lee appear on the landing above the foyer. Han looks up and 
sees them.

HAN 
Mr. Russ, I think there has been a 
misunderstanding.

Both Russ and Lee are looking embarrassed.

HAN 
I would like you to meet, Mr. Lee.

Lee looks up and bows to them both. 

LEE 
Excuse me very much.

Agents slowly lower their guns. Lee holds up TWO REVOLVERS.

LEE
(to Russ and Whitney)
Oh yes, your guns.

Russ fumes.

RUSS 
Where the hell is --

CUT TO:

INT. CARTER'S SEDAN -- NIGHT

Pulling up to the Consulate Compound.  Holding out his I.D. and passing 
FBI AGENT WILLIS.

FBI AGENT WILLIS 
Good job, Detective. Real nice piece 
Œa work. 

Carter gives him a look.  No idea what he's talking' about. But he must 
have done something good.

CARTER 
OK. Yeah. Thanks.

INT. CHINESE CONSULATE RESIDENCE -- CONTINUOUS

Carter enters, heads for the office when the door opens and Han and Lee 
come out.  Carter stops, floored.

CARTER 
Hey!

Lee smiles.  Turns to the Ambassador.

LEE 
This is the agent I was telling you 
about.  Mr. Carter.

Han looks at Carter.  But Carter just stares at Lee.

LEE 
I'm sure Mr. Carter was only concerned 
with my best interests.  He did not 
understand the importance of my 
getting here quickly.

Russ exits the office, staring at Carter.  Carter realizes he's in some 
shit, unless he can do a little fast bullshitting.  Carter suddenly 
smiles at Lee.

CARTER 
Sorry I'm late.  Guess the directions 
were okay.

Carter looks at Lee's wet clothes.

CARTER (cont'd)
I see you came via Malibu.

HAN
(to Lee)
Come on. Let's get you some dry 
clothes.

RUSS 
Carter, can I have a moment?

CARTER 
Of course, sir.  All the time you 
want.

Carter smiles at Lee as he moves past and enters the Lion's den.  The 
door closes.

INT. HAN'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Russ faces off with Carter.

RUSS 
What do you mean you lost him?! How 
could you lose him?!

CARTER 
Try a bus load of - no, make that two 
bus loads of Chinese --

The PHONE RINGS.  Russ turns to the phone.

CARTER 
You want me to take care of this, you 
gotta use me. 

Russ ignores him.  Han enters, moving quickly to the desk.

CARTER 
You understand what I'm sayin'?

RUSS 
Carter, shut up!

Lee steps into the room.  All attention on Han.  Russ nods to him.  Han 
answers.  The ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT CLICKS INTO ACTION - 
recording, tracking.  The phone conversation is in Mandarin.

HAN 
Hello.

SANG'S VOICE 
Ambassador Han.

HAN 
Yes.

SANG'S VOICE 
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I 
will assume you are lying.

Han looks at Russ.  Russ hesitates, then nods.

HAN 
My daughter.

SANG'S VOICE 
She's fine.

HAN 
Can I speak with her?

INTERCUT WITH SANG - INT. 620 SOUTH MAIN

Sang speaks on the phone, seated at an empty table .

SANG 
Not yet.

Sang looks at his watch, in no hurry.

INT. HAN'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Whitney is watching the clock.  They need a few more moments to make 
the trace.

RUSS 
(whisper)
Keep him talking.

Phone conversation continues in Mandarin.

HAN 
How do I know she is alive?

SANG 
Have to take my word for it.

HAN 
What do you want?

SANG 
I want you to think for a moment... 
what is a daughter worth?

Whitney motions to keep talking.  They're close.  Very close to making 
the trace.

HAN
Everything.

SANG 
Good.  I'd hate to think less.

Whitney signals.  They've got the trace.

SANG 
But we've talked enough for now.  I'll 
call later, after you've  had a chance 
to think about... the mistakes you've 
made.

The phone line goes dead.  Whitney holds up the paper.

WHITNEY 
620 South Main. Downtown.

Russ, Whitney and Agents immediately head for the door, past Lee and 
Carter.

EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE -- NIGHT

Russ, Whitney, other Agents exit, moving to cars.  Lee hurries up 
behind Russ.

LEE 
Mr. Russ --

Russ stops, turns to Lee.

RUSS 
Mr. Lee, Detective Carter has been 
assigned to help you.  He is the very 
best at...
(pause)
...what he does. Excuse me.

A car pulls up.  Russ gets in.  Car pulls away.  Followed by others.  
Lee watches, anger building, but trying not to show it.  Carter comes 
up behind him.

Both of them watch the FBI cars peel out.  Then they turn and look at 
each other.  Not exactly a match made in heaven.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

THREE UNMARKED FBI CARS pull out of the Consulate Compound.  Move 
quickly down the street.  Carter's sedan pulls out a few moments later.

INT. SEDAN -- NIGHT

Carter behind the wheel.  Lee next to him.  Both are quiet for a 
moment, then --

CARTER 
You're a regular god damn acrobat, 
aren't you?  Bet you feel real good 
makin' me look like an asshole.

LEE 
It was not my intent --

CARTER 
Right....

LEE 
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire 
to show me a good time, but that is 
not the reason I am here.

CARTER
Let me just clarify a few things.  I 
don't care what kind of cop you are in 
China, you have no jurisdiction in 
America.  Without me you are just 
another tourist.

Carter and Lee exchange a look.

CARTER 
So don't pull that shit again.

Carter suddenly turns the sedan in another direction from the FBI cars 
they're following.

LEE
What about them?

CARTER
I know a shortcut.

LEE
Shortcut?

CARTER
You don't know what a shortcut is?

Lee shakes his head.

CARTER (cont'd)
(to himself)
Lame ass country.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Carter is repeatedly hitting the speed dial on his CELL PHONE while he 
drives. We hear that HEE HAW sound you get when you're in cell phone 
hell.

CARTER
(tossing the phone)
Piece Œa shit.

Carter starts looking for a phone booth. Lee, meanwhile, picks up the 
cell phone and expertly RIPS it open.

He starts studying the inner workings of the phone.

LEE
Accessory board probably burnt out.

Carter looks over at his phone and freaks.

CARTER
Hey!  What did you do to my phone, 
man!? You people can't keep your hands 
off electronics, can you?!

ON THE SEDAN

He pulls across the street from a MINI-MART. We see EMPTY PHONE BOOTHS 
out front.

CARTER (cont'd)
Wait here.

Carter shuts the door.  Starts away.  Stops.  Then returns to the car, 
reaches in and quickly snaps a hand cuff on Lee's arm and another on 
the steering wheel.

CARTER 
Relax. This is somethin' we do in L.A.  
Always cuff a friend or a wife or a 
kid to the steering' wheel so 
nobody'll steal the car.  It's like a 
human anti-theft device.
(big smile)
Be right back.

Carter crosses to the Mini Mart.  Lee watches him, then looks at his 
wrist cuffed to the steering wheel.

EXT. MINI-MART -- NIGHT

Carter is HOLDING on the pay phone when a GUY IN A TURBAN comes out of 
the store.

CARTER 
Nice hat.
(on the phone)
Hey, Johnson! It's Carter.  Listen, 
meet me at 620 S. Main. Some Federal 
type action is gonna be going down 
there. 

INTERCUT WITH JOHNSON

She's at her desk.

JOHNSON
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the 
way.

CARTER
No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back 
up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need 
you, baby.

         CUT TO:

INT. THE SEDAN-NIGHT

Carter comes back across the street and gets in the car. 

CARTER
OK, now I'm gonna show you what a 
shortcut is...

Carter reaches down to start the car and finds that his steering wheel 
is gone. Along with Lee.

CARTER (cont'd)
Sonuvabitch!

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT

UNMARKED CARS pulling up.  FBI SPECIAL TACTICS TEAMS arriving and 
deploying.  The target: the OLD OFFICE BUILDING across the street.  A 
TEAM OF BLACK CLAD FBI moves into the ground floor.

A TAXI pulls up.  Lee exits, carrying Carter's steering wheel because 
he's still attached to it. Whitney sees him first and does a double 
take.

WHITNEY
Jesus H...

Lee moves toward Whitney.

WHITNEY (cont'd)
Where's Carter?

LEE 
Lost I think.  Which building?

Russ walks up.

RUSS 
Mr. Lee, this is an FBI operation.

LEE
I was brought here to help.

RUSS
Please stay back.

Two AGENTS walk up ready to restrain him.

LEE 
She is very important to me.  You must 
let me --

RUSS 
Mr. Lee, the very fact that you know 
her compromises your judgement.

Whitney comes up behind Russ, interrupting --

WHITNEY 
Area secured.  Teams ready.

Another TAXI pulls up.  Carter jumps out.  Storming toward Lee.

CARTER 
He stole my wheel! 

WHITNEY
This is pathetic.

CARTER
I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!
(turns to Lee)
Your ass is goin' to jail!

Carter WHISPERS to the two restraining agents:

CARTER (cont'd)
Hold me back.
(yelling)
After I kick it first!

The TWO AGENTS PULL Carter away from Lee.  Russ has had enough.

RUSS 
(to OTHER AGENTS)
Get them the hell out of here!
(on the radio)
You are cleared to go.

ON THE BUILDING

We can see FLASHLIGHTS moving in the windows as the team moves to the 
top floor.

INT. OLD BUILDING - OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

The DOOR is KICKED OPEN.  AGENTS BURST INTO THE ROOM, Drop to 
positions, ready to fire. They move quickly through the office, 
checking every corner.  But the office is empty.

Except for the table, chair and phone.

LEAD AGENT TACTICAL TEAM 
(into radio)
Area secured.  The room is empty.

INTERCUT WITH RUSS ON THE STREET as he gets the message.

RUSS 
Dammit!

LEAD AGENT TACTICAL TEAM 
A table, chair and phone.

THE PHONE RINGS.  The Lead Agent turns to the phone. First ring, second 
ring.

LEAD AGENT TACTICAL TEAM 
And it's ringing.
(Third ring)
What do you want me to do?

Russ hesitates.  Then starts running for the building.

RUSS 
I'm on my way.

FOURTH RING.  FIFTH RING.  Finally he takes off his helmet, picks up 
the receiver.

EXT. OLD BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

The TOP FLOOR OF THE BUILDING SUDDENLY BLOWS UP in a huge fireball.  
Russ and Agents are knocked down.  Lee and Carter take cover from the 
debris.  CLOUD OF DUST AND SMOKE roll over them.

When Lee gets up, he's facing away from the building.  He sees 
something.

P.O.V. OF A MAN -- CONTINUOUS

Standing in a doorway as the FLASH FROM THE EXPLOSION LIGHTS up his 
face for a moment.  And we recognize him. It's Sang.

EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

Lee is stunned.  He gets up quickly, starts running after Sang who 
disappears down an alley into darkness.

Carter sees Lee.

CARTER 
Hey! 
(to himself)
Not this time...

Carter goes after him.

EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

Lee runs after Sang into the alley.

EXT. ALLEY INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS

Sang is running hard when he turns and sees Lee.

Sang jumps onto a DUMPSTER in the alley, grabs a FIRE ESCAPE LADDER and 
starts climbing.

Lee leaps onto the dumpster, grabs the ladder and goes up.

Sang climbs two stories, smashes a WINDOW and climbs into the building.

ON CARTER

He rounds the corner and sees Lee going up the building.

CARTER 
What are you doing, god damn it!?

Carter runs for the dumpster and the fire escape.

INT. BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

We're in an ABANDONED ATRIUM moving down an open, dirty hallway. Lee 
moves quickly and quietly. He peaks over the edge of the atrium:

LEE'S POV

Two floors below we see a TUNNEL filled with trash.

Lee passes SCAFFOLDING that's been abandoned. He stops and listens. 
Suddenly, we hear SOMEONE RUNNING. Lee takes off.

ON CARTER

He climbs through the window and takes off down the open hallway.

ON SANG

He explodes around a corner and runs over a BRIDGE connecting both 
sides of the atrium. A sign on the bridge says DANGER-UNDER 
CONSTRUCTION.

The bridge CREAKS and moves. Sang STUMBLES and drops something. But 
Sang doesn't stop and he makes it over the bridge.

Lee runs up right behind Sang but he slows when he sees the bridge and 
the sign. He starts over slowly and picks up WHAT SANG DROPPED.

CLOSE ON

A DETONATOR

The bridge CREAKS Loudly. But Lee scampers across.

Carter is right on his heels. He doesn't even see the sign and 
accelerates as he runs over the bridge. We hear a massive CRACK!

CARTER 
Oh shiiiiit!

The bridge gives way and Carter drops like a brick.

He falls two stories and hits the tunnel floor on top of a huge mass of 
debris.

Dust swirls for a moment. Carter doesn't move and then:

CARTER 
...ahhh.

ON LEE

He's across the atrium when he sees Carter fall. Lee grabs a PIPE and 
quickly swings himself down to the floor of the tunnel.

He finds Carter covered in dust and debris.

CARTER
Am I dead? 

Suddenly we HEAR SCREECHING TIRES.  Both men turn.  A CAR IS SCREAMING 
DOWN THE TUNNEL toward them.

Lee looks around. No where to go.

At the last instant, he grabs Carter and they roll out of the way.

The car ROARS by and goes out the other end of the tunnel.

CARTER 
You make the plate?

LEE 
What plate?

CARTER 
The license!  You get it?!

LEE 
No.

CARTER 
What the hell kinda cop are you?!  

LEE 
Did you make the plate?!

CARTER 
It was my ass that almost got trashed!

LEE 
He was trying to kill me, not you.

CARTER
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in 
L.A. after what?  Six hours?

LEE 
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.

CARTER 
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my 
ass again.

LEE AND CARTER
I might have...
(pause)
It does not matter now.

Lee starts walking down the tunnel.

CARTER 
Hey, wait a second!

Lee keeps walking.

CARTER 
You tryin' to make this out to be my 
fault?  Like it was me who got in the 
way of you?!  You gotta not be 
serious.
(nothing from Lee)
That what you're thinking'?!  Come on, 
say it if you think it. SAY IT!

Lee stops, turns back.

LEE 
When a man steps in dung, it is 
obvious.  There is no need to rub it 
in his face.  The smell is the same.

CARTER 
What is that, some kind of Chinese 
proverb?

LEE 
No. I just made it up.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE OLD BUILDING -- NIGHT

Ambulances taking the injured away.  FIRE FIGHTERS battle the burning 
building.  Russ and Whitney stand grimly watching the carnage.

JOHNSON walks up to them.

JOHNSON
(to Russ)
Excuse me. I'm looking for Detective 
Carter...

RUSS
Who are you?

Johnson pulls her badge.

JOHNSON
LAPD. Explosives Division.

Russ suddenly gets angry.

RUSS
Did Carter send for you?

JOHNSON
Yes sir.

RUSS
Explosives Division?!  Well, you're 
too god damn late!

Lee and Carter walk up. 

CARTER
Yo, Johnson...

RUSS
(interrupting)
You think this is funny, Carter?  You 
send for someone from Explosives!? 
Four men just died in there!

CARTER
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an 
expert!

RUSS
That's what you were supposed to be!

Johnson is starting to back away.

JOHNSON
Look, I don't know what's goin' on 
here, but I'm history. 

She starts to walk back to her car.

CARTER
No, wait!

He runs after Johnson and catches her as she gets into her car.

JOHNSON
Hey, I don't need that. You just got 
your last back-up from me.

She squeals away from the scene.

Carter looks beat up and defeated.

We HEAR a PHONE START TO RING.  Once, twice.  Carter turns.

A PAY PHONE is ringing next to a building.  Three, four, five.  Carter, 
annoyed, finally crosses to the booth, answers --

CARTER 
You're calling a phone booth, asshole.

Hangs up. He gets five steps away when it starts to RING AGAIN.  He 
stops, turns back.  Answers.

CARTER 
You know what a phone booth is?!

MAN'S VOICE 
The bomb was meant as a demonstration 
of our sincerity.  If you want the 
Ambassador's daughter back alive, 
listen and do not talk.

Carter realizes now who he's got on the other end of the line.  He 
covers the receiver.

CARTER 
Lee!  It's him!

MAN'S VOICE 
The first drop will be made tomorrow.  
At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be 
fifty million.

CARTER 
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United 
States dollars?

MAN'S VOICE 
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than 
a fifty.

CARTER 
That's some serious poundage in 
dollars.

Carter covers the phone and tries to get the attention of the FBI.

CARTER 
Hey, it's him.  On the phone.
(back to phone)
Where do you think an Ambassador's 
gonna come up with that kinda cash?  I 
mean, how much can a guy like that 
take home, after taxes?  And in China.
(covers phone again)
It's him!  Get your asses over here!

Lee finally turns and hears him.

CARTER (cont'd)
(back to phone)
I mean I don't think he even gets paid 
in dollars.  They probably pay in yang 
or yin or...rice, whatever it is they 
got there.

Lee walks over. Carter holds the phone so Lee can hear.

MAN'S VOICE
What is your name?

CARTER 
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know 
each other. This is a good thing. I'm 
Carter.

MAN'S VOICE 
Carter.  I just want to be able to 
tell the Ambassador who was 
responsible for the death of his 
daughter because he talked too much.

CARTER 
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was 
gettin' on here!

MAN'S VOICE 
Shut up!

CARTER 
OK. Say what it is.

MAN'S VOICE 
The Ambassador will receive 
instructions for the drop, half an 
hour before it is to be made.  If it 
is successful, there will be more.  
Thank you, Agent Carter.

The phone goes dead.  Carter exchanges a look with Lee.

EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

Russ is on his car phone --

RUSS 
(into phone)
-- as soon as we get a team in 
place...yes, sir.  I'll make sure it 
happens.

Russ hangs up as Carter approaches.

CARTER 
Fifty million --

Russ turns angrily.

RUSS 
I don't think you need to be here!

Russ turns away.  Whitney gives Carter a look, then follows.

CARTER 
That's what the man wants for the 
girl.  Just called on the pay phone 
across the street.  With the 
instructions for the first drop.  Just 
thought you might be interested.  It's 
what they call a ransom demand.

Carter turns and starts walking away.

RUSS 
Carter!

Carter turns slowly.

CARTER 
Hmmmm?

RUSS 
Don't play bullshit games with me.

CARTER 
Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador 
will receive a phone call telling him 
where the drop is.  He said the bomb 
was a demonstration of their 
sincerity.

Carter turns to go, then stops, turns back. 

CARTER 
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man.  
Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, 
Asian.  Anything else I can do for the 
FBI, sir?

RUSS 
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or 
should I call and ask for somebody who 
can handle it?

CARTER
No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.

Carter offers a smile, then starts back toward Lee.  The smile 
disappears as he turns his back on Russ.

CARTER (cont'd)
(to himself)
Prick.

CUT TO:

EXT. CARTER'S APARTMENT- NIGHT

We watch Carter and Lee get out of a cab in the Los Felis district. 
Over this we HEAR:

CARTER VO
I thought you said you'd never been to 
America before.  How the hell did you 
know where you were goin' if you never 
been here before?  Huh?

LEE VO
(pissed off)
You had map in car. Chinese can read 
maps, too. Where will you take me now, 
Disneyland?  

CARTER VO
Hey, I was just doin' my job.
(pause)
We're goin' to my crib.

LEE VO
Crib? What crib?

CARTER VO
My home, man, my home!

CUT TO:

INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT-NIGHT

Carter and Lee come through the door into a dark leather living room 
set up for one thing: pussy.

Carter hits a series of switches. Subdued lights come on, a stereo 
starts with nasty rap, a gas fireplace pops on, and SOFT PORN starts 
playing on the VCR.

Carter sees Lee's reaction to the setting.

CARTER 
I can't help it. I'm a hopeless 
romantic.

Carter disappears into a bedroom.

Lee wanders over to a shelf with a collection of LOVE OILS.

Carter sticks his head out of the bedroom as he slips on a clean shirt.

CARTER 
Hey, don't drop that shit. It's 
imported. 

He goes back in the bedroom and talks from there.

CARTER VO
Look, none of this has gone down 
right.  Too many big heads thinkin' 
they don't need nothin' from nobody.  
Forgettin' a man's daughter is gone.

He comes back out buttoning up a clean pair of pants.

CARTER
I know I been part of it so... I'm 
sorry.

Lee looks at Carter for a beat.

LEE 
I worked with Ambassador Han and his 
family for ten years.  He wanted me to 
come with them to America.  If I had, 
this might not have happened.

CARTER 
Don't go there...

LEE 
I could not come.  I had other 
responsibilities.

CARTER 
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up 
in some bar, drinking' to forget all 
the things we shoulda done and then 
you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs 
again. Then I'll really get depressed.

LEE 
I also did not come because I think I 
would not fit in America. 

CARTER 
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at 
L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My 
momma's from Detroit, my dad's from 
Atlanta, they met in Texas, got 
married in Vegas and I was born in 
Alabama.  So where the hell am I from?  
Kenya?

Carter looks at Lee and makes a decision.

CARTER 
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell 
me straight: did you really know the 
guy you were chasin'?

LEE 
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime 
family. He may be Juntao himself.
(reaches into pocket)
And he dropped this.

Lee retrieves a small BLACK CYLINDER.  Carter glances at it.  Then 
recognizes the DETONATOR.

CARTER
Looks like a clue to me, Detective 
Lee.

Carter smiles at Lee. Lee slowly smiles back at Carter.

CARTER (cont'd)
Let's go see a friend of mine.

CUT TO:

EXT. CARTER'S APARTMENT-NIGHT

Lee and Carter come out a back door. Carter points below them on the 
street where a HUGE 1971 WHITE ELDORADO CONVERTIBLE sits gleaming under 
the street lights.

CARTER
(proudly)
The Carter ride.

Lee takes in the car as they walk up to it.

LEE
(in awe)
This is bigger than my apartment in 
Hong Kong.

They get in.

CARTER
Welcome to the wide open spaces of 
America!

ON THE CADILLAC

It PURRS away from the curb and FLOATS down the road.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. POOL HALL-NIGHT

The Caddy pulls up to a pool hall in a semi sleazy area.

CARTER
When we go inside, you let me handle 
everything, you hear?  This is my man, 
you dig?  My informant. You know what 
an informant is?

LEE
Stooly.

CARTER
What?

LEE
Stool pigeon.

CARTER
Yeah, somethin' like that.
(talking very fast)
OK, now this is a nasty ass place. 
When you go into a place like this, 
the most important thing is control. 
You got to maintain control. You 
following me? You lose it, you get 
hurt. Now, you're my responsibility 
and I don't want you hurt. You 
understand?  OK, let's go.

Carter gets out of the car and walks away. Lee doesn't move.

After a beat, Carter comes back.

CARTER (cont'd)
What?

LEE
You talk too fast. 

CARTER
Come on!

CUT TO:

INT. POOL HALL-NIGHT

The boys walk into a smoky hall patronized mostly by black people.

Carter leads Lee past pool tables as they work their way to the very 
back of the room. Carter makes his presence known as he walks.

He passes a guy taking a hit off a JOINT. He stops.

CARTER
(to the guy)
That better not be what I think it is. 
Gimme that.

Carter swipes the joint out of the guy's hand. He takes a big hit. He 
holds it and tastes it for a beat.

Lee is looking at Carter in disbelief.

CARTER (cont'd)
Wait a minute.

He takes ANOTHER HIT. Gives the joint back.

CARTER (cont'd)
Don't leave town. I'm watching you.

Carter keeps moving. He walks by a luscious looking girl with tight 
stuff on.

CARTER (cont'd)
You see my ride, baby? You'd look good 
in that. Go outside. Take a look. 

He walks by a guy who gives him a dirty look.

CARTER (cont'd)
What are you lookin' at, dickhead?

They end up in the back of the room where FOUR GUYS play nine ball, 
three more wait and four nasty looking BITCHES watch the action.

One of the players looks nervous when he sees Carter. This is OSCAR.

OSCAR
What's up, man?

CARTER
Let's take a walk, Oscar. You got 
something Œa mine. 
(to Lee)
Stay here.

Carter takes Oscar's arm and starts moving him out the side door. Two 
BIG BLACK DUDES in the foursome start to move to Oscar's aid. But he 
holds up his hands.

OSCAR
It's cool. 

Oscar and Carter go out the back door. Lee sits down against the wall.

One of the nasty bitches watching the game is ASIAN. She gives Lee a 
little smile. He smiles back. One of the BIG BLACK DUDES notices.

CUT TO:

EXT. AN ALLEY-NIGHT

Carter and Oscar are arguing.

OSCAR
...never, never come here! I told you 
that, god damn it! And who the hell is 
that little gook you brought with you! 

CARTER
Shut up, Oscar!  I don't take shit 
from you!  I give out the shit. That 
is the basis of our relationship. I 
give you shit and you take it!

CUT TO:

INT. THE POOL HALL-NIGHT

We're on the POV of one of the BIG BLACK DUDES who is lining up a shot. 
RACK FOCUS to Lee's face who is in perfect line for the shot.

BIG DUDE
(still lining up)
What are you smiling at, rice bowl?

LEE
Who, me?

BIG DUDE
You making slant eyes at my girl 
friend? 

Lee looks again at the Asian girl and inadvertently smiles. He catches 
himself and forces a frown.

WHACK! Big dude hits the object ball so hard, it hops the table and 
heads right for Lee's head. Lee catches it like a baseball line drive, 
right in front of his nose.

Nobody moves for a beat, mainly because everyone is impressed with 
Lee's catch.

LEE 
My friend does not want me to get 
hurt.

Big Dude WHIPS the cue stick like a bat at Lee's head. Lee ducks and it 
SHATTERS against his chair. BIG DUDE #2 lunges for Lee who BOPS him 
with the pool ball he caught.

And they're off! Two other guys jump on Lee and start pounding the shit 
out of Œem. Lee flips one onto the table and elbows the other. The two 
Big Dudes grab fresh cues.

CUT TO:

EXT. AN ALLEY-NIGHT

Oscar is turning the detonator over in his hand.

OSCAR
I ain't the man to be telling you 
about this.

CARTER
Then who is?

OSCAR
Shit, you already busted his ass.
Lafontaine. The dude who blew up the 
diner. He's your leverage. 
(holding up the detonator)
He knows where this shit come from.

CUT TO:

INT. THE POOL HALL-NIGHT

WHAM!  Lee is thrown against the back wall. The nasty girls all run 
past him and retreat to the ladies room.

Lee grabs a cue and comes out swinging. He backs three guys away and 
then stops.

BIG DUDE #1 is swinging his own cue. Lee paries like a fencer. He puts 
one hand behind his back and continues to parry and thrust. Finally, he 
pokes Big Dude in the forehead with his tip leaving a blue chalk spot. 
Then he turns the cue around and belts the guy on the spot.

Lee turns and BREAKS his cue over two guys simultaneously, ducks a cue 
shot to his own head, and kicks one guy over a table and drops another 
with a flurry of hands.

Lee looks around. The girls are hiding in the john. The hall has 
emptied. The guys he fought are all knocked out and UNDER tables.

Carter comes in the back door.

CARTER
(to Lee)
Let's go.
(he looks around)
Everybody take off?

LEE
Took off. Yes. They took off.

Lee catches up with Carter.

CARTER
You see what I'm sayin'? You control 
the space.

LEE
Thank you. I learn a great deal.

CARTER
It happens.

Carter spots one of the fighters ON THE FLOOR as they walk out. It's 
the same guy who was smoking the joint. The guy moans as they go past.

CARTER (cont'd)
(to the doper/fighter)
Hey, lightweight, I told you to lay 
off that shit.
(over his shoulder)
Get an education!

CUT TO:

EXT. COUNTY JAIL -- NIGHT

ESTABLISHING the PRISON.  The Cadillac SCREECHES to a stop.

INT. COUNTY JAIL -- CONTINUOUS

Carter is talking to the OFFICER (BOBBY) behind the GLASS BOOTH.

OFFICER 
It's eleven o'clock at night, Carter! 
They're all locked down, lights out.

CARTER 
Yeah, but they're criminals, Bobby. 
Who gives a shit if they lose some 
sleep?  Come on: wake his ass up.

BOBBY shakes his head but he picks up the phone.

INT. JAIL INTERVIEW ROOM -- LATER

Lee and Carter are waiting.  Door opens.  Bobby leads Lafontaine into 
the room. Lafontaine is pissed off, especially when he sees Carter.

LAFONTAINE
I got nothing to say to you.

Carter motions for the guard to exit.

CARTER 
Give us five minutes, Bobby.

The guard departs.

CARTER 
Sit down.

Lafontaine sits. Carter puts the detonator on the table. Pushes it 
across to him.  Lafontaine picks it up, looks at Carter with a sick 
smile and PRESSES THE BUTTON.

LAFONTAINE
Boom.

Lafontaine shoves the detonator back at Carter.  Carter picks it up 
with a HANDKERCHIEF.

CARTER 
You got a boy friend in here yet? 
ŒCause you're gonna need somebody to 
kiss your ass goodbye.

LAFONTAINE
What are you talking about?

CARTER
You're movin' to death row. See, your 
fingerprints are now on the murder 
weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I 
turn this into the lab, they're gonna 
find Lafontaine all over it. And we 
already know...
(holding up detonator)
...this is your MO.

LAFONTAINE
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't 
notice but I'm in jail!

CARTER 
All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds 
can do a lot with a good implication.  
Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet 
you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of 
time to find a nice fella.

Lafontaine looks at Carter and Lee for a moment, then --

LAFONTAINE
You sonuvabitch.

CARTER 
I'm waitin' here for a name.

Nothing from Lafontaine for a beat. Carter stands, starts for the door.  
Lee following.

LAFONTAINE 
I've never seen him.

Carter ignores him.  Starts to knock for the Guard.

LAFONTAINE 
Juntao.

Carter and Lee exchange glances.

CARTER
Where do we find him?

LAFONTAINE
You don't. He finds you. Through his 
people. 

Carter and Lee wait for more.

LAFONTAINE (cont'd)
(quietly)
Fang Shan. A restaurant. China Town.

CUT TO:

EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE COMPOUND -- NIGHT

The FBI cars are parked in front.  Lights burning in Han's office.  
ARMED GUARDS now in front.

INT. HAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Han has just received the news from Russ. The mood in the room is grim.

HAN 
I am so sorry about your men.

RUSS 
Yes sir, me too. The State Department 
has authorized release of the funds.  
We'll have to make the first drop at 
7.  As soon as they pick up the money, 
we've got Œem.  

HAN 
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?

RUSS 
Don't worry, he's with Carter. 

EXT. CARTER'S CAR(MOVING)-NIGHT

Lee is explaining as Carter drives. 

LEE 
Juntao was one of the worst crime 
bosses in Hong Kong.  When China 
regained control, he was forced out.  
By Ambassador Han.

Carter flips his cell phone open.

CARTER 
Let's get us a photo and description.  
We'll have an APB out while we stake 
out the restaurant.  

LEE 
That is a problem. There is no 
description of Juntao. No known 
photograph.

CARTER 
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what 
he looks like?  Come on, there must be 
witnesses somewhere.

LEE 
Juntao's standing orders were to kill 
everyone. There were never witnesses.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CHINA TOWN -- NIGHT

The architecture.  The signs.  It's a different world. The Cadillac 
cruises down the street.  It's late. Most things are closed.

EXT. CHINATOWN -- LATER

The Cadillac is parked on the side street.

INT. CAR-- CONTINUOUS

Carter and Lee are watching Fang Shan restaurant, eating from cartons 
of Chinese food.

LEE 
You like it?

CARTER 
Yeah, it's good.

LEE 
That one is my favorite.  Chicken puff 
with shark fin.

Carter starts chewing a little slower.

LEE 
And the Eel is very good, too.  But I 
have had better Camel's Hump.

Carter has trouble swallowing.  Puts down his food.

LEE 
You want more?

CARTER 
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and 
hump, you know, gives me gas.
(belches)
Œscuse me.

Silence for a moment, then Lee motions to the radio.

LEE 
Music?

A beat, then Carter nods.  Lee reaches for the radio.

CARTER 
No!  This time I pick.

Carter turns on the radio.  Dials around until he finds WAR.

CARTER 
Now, that's American music.

LEE 
Yes, I know this song.

CARTER 
You know War?

LEE 
Who does not know War?
(starts)
³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What 
is it good for?  Absolutely nothing.  
Good-God, you all.²

Carter just stares at Lee for a moment in disbelief.

CARTER 
That's not how it goes.

LEE 
Yes, I think so.

CARTER 
No, no.  It's not good-God you all!  
It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!

LEE 
Yee-aww.

Carter turns off the radio.

CARTER 
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be 
angry.  Like you're pissed off.

LEE 
Good God, ya'll!

CARTER 
No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do 
it one time.  That's it.

MONTAGE BEGINS

Carter gets out of the car.  Lee follows.  Carter limbers up for a 
moment, then starts a dance move to get him into the beat.

CARTER 
War!  huuuuhh!  wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh!  
what's it good for?  absolutely 
nuthin'  good-gawd ya'll!

Lee gives it his best shot, trying to mimic Carter's dance move.  But 
it's more martial arts than dance.

LEE AND CARTER 
War!  huuuuhh!  wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh!  
what's it good for?  absolutely 
nuthin'  good-gawd ya'll

Lee tries to get into the rhythm with Carter, undulating his body to 
Carter's motion.  But Carter watches Lee's martial arts interpretation 
and he starts to alter his moves to Lee.

LEE AND CARTER 
War!  huuuuhh!  wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh!  
what's it good for?  absolutely 
nuthin'  good-gawd ya'll!

Both of them are moving side by side, in step as they sing.  Totally 
involved.  Rocking out.

LEE AND CARTER 
War!  huuuuhh!  wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh!  
what's it good for?  absolutely 
nuthin'  good-gawd ya'll!

They both turn and face each other. As they dance, Lee BEGINS TO TEACH 
CARTER his quick move for taking someone's gun away.

EXT. LONG SHOT - STREET -- CONTINUOUS

A FEW NIGHT PEOPLE have stopped to listen.  Staring at the Cadillac 
parked on the street.  With Carter singing at the top of his lungs and 
Lee teaching him the quick moves to the music.

CARTER

SAME SHOT FADES to the next morning.

INT. CADILLAC- CHINA TOWN -- MORNING

Lee and Carter are asleep in the car.  Carter's head is slumped against 
the window.  A BUS ROARS past.  They wake up.  Carter groans.

LEE
Are you OK?

CARTER 
I got to stop that dancing in the 
street Œtill all hours.

Carter stretches as Lee hops out HUMMING WAR, and opens the door for 
Carter.

CUT TO:

THREE CARS pull up in front of the bank.  Ambassador Han gets out of

Carter and Lee are at a table.  Carter is having coffee. Lee is eating 
breakfast - rice and fish - with chopsticks.  All the patrons are 
Asian. Carter is staring at Lee's food. Lee notices.

LEE
Want some?

CARTER
No, fish is a PM food.

LEE
Excuse me?

CARTER
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. 
We're talking strictly an after twelve 
noon food type.

Lee turns and looks out the window.

LEE'S P.O.V.

He sees Sang entering the Fang Shan restaurant.

BACK AT THE TABLE

Lee stands suddenly.

CARTER 
What?!

LEE 
It's him.

Carter looks out the window.  But the street is already full of ASIAN 
PEOPLE.

CARTER
Which one?

LEE 
Going into the restaurant.

Carter throws some money onto the table.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

Carter and Lee exit the restaurant, moving down the street.

LEE
This is my territory now.  You are my 
responsibility.

CARTER
(pointing down)
This concrete?  This is still America.

LEE 
What do you hear?

They listen.  CHINESE MUSIC filters out from one of the shops.  SEVERAL 
CONVERSATIONS are in Chinese.  There is nothing that would suggest this 
is America.

CARTER 
Walk two more blocks and neither of us 
will understand the language.  Look, 
we can't take a chance on him 
recognizing you. Especially if he's 
Juntao. I'll go in, you back me up.  
That's the way it's gonna be.

The Asian man who drove the van (Chung) lifts the top of a DUMPSTER, 
throws a BLACK GARBAGE BAG inside.

FROM UNDERNEATH THE DUMPSTER

A sewer grate is REMOVED.  Shu, one of the other men involved in the 
kidnapping, reaches up, opens a hidden door in the bottom of the 
Dumpster and pulls out the black trash bag.  He drops down into the 
sewer.  The sewer grate comes down on top as if nothing is out of 
place.

INT. FANG SHAN RESTAURANT - BASEMENT

A trap door opens and Shu crawls into the room.  SEVERAL ASIAN MEN are

Open for business.  Lee and Carter cross the street.

CARTER 
OK, when you go in, just act like

LEE 
I am from outa town.

CARTER 
No, like a tourist.  You know, things 
to see, money to burn, interested in 
stupid shit.

LEE 

Ah.  Like this.

Lee looks around a lot and smiles.

CARTER 
Yeah, yeah, good.  You're havin' fun.   
Lookin' for a good time.  You know, 
watch the women, look at their legs 
and shit.  Like that's all you can 
think about.  Gettin' some.  Like her.

Carter motions at AN ATTRACTIVE ASIAN WOMAN moving toward them.  Lee 
watches her walk past.  He smiles politely. Carter watches him for a 
beat, then --

CARTER 
That ain't gonna get it. Watch this.

Carter screws up his face as if he's really enjoying watching the woman 
- like she's the best thing he's ever seen.  A complete politically 
incorrect slob of a man. The only thing missing is the drool.

CARTER 
Like that.

LEE 
I am sorry, but I have too much 
respect for women.

Carter stares at him blankly, then puts an arm around him.

CARTER 
This is nothin' personal with women.  
We are undercover.  It's okay to be a 
player when you're undercover.  Okay?

Lee hesitates, then nods.  Carter takes out his i.d.

CARTER 
You've got no jurisdiction here so I'm 
gonna give you my i.d.  If we get into 
some shit, you're L.A.P.D.

Carter opens his i.d. - Carter is black, Lee is Asian - that's one 
difference.

CARTER 
Hold it like this, flip it open, flip 
it closed.  It's the attitude that 
says who you are, not the i.d.

Carter flips the i.d. with authority, partially covering his photo with 
his hand.  We hardly even see the photo. Carter hands the i.d. back to 
Lee.

CARTER 
You got to make people think this is 
you.
(re: Carter's photo)
You gotta believe that face is your 
face.  

Lee tries the flip.

CARTER 
More wrist.  It's gotta snap.  Can't 
be limp. You do limp, they look at the 
photo, we're dead.

Carter points to his face.  Lee tries the flip with more wrist.  
Snapping it open.

CARTER 
Good.  Gimme a couple minutes, then 
come in.  And take this.

Carter slips Lee his gun.

LEE 
No, please, I don't --

CARTER 
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're 
backin' up.  Take the damn gun.

Lee hesitates, then takes the gun and puts it into his pocket.

Carter enters the restaurant.  Moves to the HOSTESS, a pretty young

HOSTESS 
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't know --

Carter puts on his best Johnny Cochran.

CARTER 
Tell Mister Juntao Johnny Cochran's 
little brother...Joey is here. Joey 
Cochran. I am the legal advisor of 
record for Mister Henry Lafontaine. I 
need to discuss some legal 
ramifications with him.

Carter takes the menu from her.

figure.

Griffin and Sang watch him.

SANG 
Maybe I have seen him.  I'm not sure.

GRIFFIN 
Bring him up.

Sang heads for the door when ANOTHER MONITOR catches Griffin's 
attention.  The MONITOR reveals the Hostess seating a MAN at a table.  
It's Lee.

GRIFFIN

Sang turns at the door.  Griffin is staring at the screen.

GRIFFIN

Carter is at the urinal when he HEARS the VAN DOORS CLOSE from a 
partially open window.  Then SOMEONE SPEAKING IN MANDARIN.  Sounds 
urgent.  He moves to the window, climbs up onto the sink.

CARTER'S POV

He can see SHU talking with the DRIVER OF THE VAN, Chung. Then another 
man exits the restaurant and we just get a glimpse of him before he 
gets into the van.  It's Griffin.  The only non-Asian Carter has seen 
in awhile. And the only British accent he's heard.

GRIFFIN 
Make sure they do not leave.

Griffin pulls the van door shut and the Van moves quickly down the 
alley.  CALIFORNIA LICENSE - LIK.

CARTER - INT. MENS ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

He notes the LIK, until the bathroom door opens behind him.  ANOTHER 
MAN enters, giving Carter a look as he's still on the sink, looking out

Carter exits.  Man gives him a look.

Lee is sitting across the room.  Half hidden behind a menu.  He watches 
Sang approach Carter.  The waitress delivers the tea to Lee.  He smiles 
politely.

ATTRACTIVE WAITRESS
(in Mandarin)
Have you decided yet?

Lee, not wanting to take the menu down, shakes his head. The waitress 
departs.  Lee's attention goes back to Carter.  But he takes a sip of 
the tea.

Sang stops at Carter's table.

CARTER 
Are you Juntao?

Sang eyes him.

CARTER 
We have to talk. Or my client? He's

Upstairs.

Empty except for Lee.  Lee waits, giving the waiters time to pass.  
Then reopens the door.  Stairway clear.  Lee moves quickly up the

INT. OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Door opens. Sang enters, followed by Carter and two men.

CARTER 
Alright, if the shoe don't fit, you

A waiter moves up the stairs, tray of food held high. Not until he gets 
to the SECOND FLOOR and looks up from the tray do we see it's Lee.  He 
moves to the office. Stops again.  Bit of dizziness.  But he's okay in 
a second.

INT. OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Carter is shoved back against the wall again.

CARTER 
Hey, I'm a lawyer!  You can't do this 
to a lawyer.  You get in some deep 
shit for this kinda treatment.

Carter watches as the men go through his wallet.  Sang looks at his 
watch.  Says something in Chinese to the men.  Two of them move to 
Carter.

They pick him up.  Drag him to the door.  A knock. Everyone stops.  One 
of the men opens it.  Tray of food. Sang turns away.  Lee enters, 
glances at Carter.  And Carter suddenly pulls his arms away from the 
men.

CARTER 
I'm tellin' you, when I sue, I win!

Carter's outburst draws Sang's attention.  And Lee takes advantage - 
swinging the tray of food at him.  The metal tray smashes into Sang's 
head, food flying.

The men charge Lee.  Lee swings the tray, smacking the first two in the 
heads, blocking a punch from a third, then flinging it like a frisbee 
at Shu, catching him in the forehead.

CARTER (cont'd)
(shocked)
Damn, you're good!

Carter gets immediately decked by two guys who run into the room.

LEE
L.A.P.D.  Nobody move!

Lee snaps open Carter's i.d. with so much attitude that it flies out of 
his hand, across the room.  Hitting one of the men in the face.

LEE 
Oh no...

Carter gets up and turns on his two.  Punching one in the gut, hitting 
the other in the chin.

CARTER 
Use the gun!  USE THE GUN!

Carter gets hit, goes down again.  Lee pulls the gun just as one of the 
men hits him.  The GUN is knocked from his hand, breaks THROUGH THE 
WINDOW - gone.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - CHINATOWN -- CONTINUOUS

The Ambassador's Jaguar pulls to the curb.

INT. AMBASSADOR'S JAGUAR -- CONTINUOUS

Russ checks his watch.  Then picks up a radio.

RUSS 
(into radio)
This is Agent Russ.  We have five 
minutes.  Take your positions.

FBI CARS move past.

CUT TO:

LEE AND CARTER - INT. OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Each hitting an opponent - Lee a jab and elbow - Carter throws one to 
the gut, one to the jaw.  Two different styles.  Then they both get 
hit.  And both slam back into the wall next to each other.  Exchanging 
a quick look --

CARTER 
Where's my gun!

Before Lee can answer, Sang wakes up and pulls a gun.

Lee dives, rolls, comes up kicking.  Hitting Sang's hand as he FIRES, 
sending THE GUN across the room as THE BULLET takes out a CHUNK OF WALL 
PLASTER right next to Carter's head.

INT. RESTAURANT -- CONTINUOUS

The SOUND OF THE GUNSHOT stops everyone from eating.  And all heads 
look up.  MORE OF SANG'S MEN start for the stairs.

INT. SECOND FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS

The office door crashes open and another man slams to the floor.  Lee 
and Carter run out, right over the top of him.  As GUN FIRE ERUPTS 
behind them, CHEWING UP THE WALL.

Carter and Lee race down the stairs.  Slamming into more WAITERS.  
SCREAMS from the dining room.  PATRONS head for the door.

INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

Lee and Carter burst in.  Swinging doors hitting another waiter.  His 
tray goes flying.  He slams back into a chef who loses control of a pan 
of frying shrimp.

The kitchen panics.  Chefs and waiters try to get out of the way.  
Carter and Lee head for the back door.  And then it really hits Lee.  
He staggers.  Stops.  Carter turns.

CARTER
Come on, let's go!

Lee weaves as he tries not to fall.

CARTER 
What're you doin'?!

The door slams opens behind them.  Nailing the poor chef again.

Lee spins around, falls back into Carter's arms.

CARTER
No, no, don't do this!  This is not 
the time!

Carter pushes him up as the men charge into the kitchen. Lee takes a 
swing, but his hand accidentally hooks a pot of boiling Won Ton soup 
off the stove, flinging it back at the men as the charge in.  They duck 
the shower of scalding broth.

Then Carter starts grabbing every pot off the stove and flinging the 
hot food at the men.  Lee joins in, throwing a barrage of hot chicken, 
fish, ribs, bok choi, chow mein, and fried rice at the men.  Lee 
staggers to keep from falling.

Then Lee grabs two WHOLE CATFISH on a cutting board as Carter starts 
throwing boxes of fortune cookies at the men.

Lee attacks with the two fish.  Hits one in the head, blocks a punch 
with another.  The fish thud and SMACK with each blow.

Lee swings the FISH together, slapping one man on both sides of his 
head.  Two Catfish have never been more deadly.

Another man comes up from behind, but Lee swings the Catfish under his 
legs and CATCHES THE MAN BEHIND HIM in the groin -CATFISH MOUTH WIDE 
OPEN.  Then Lee spins around and slams his hands against the Catfish's 
mouth. The jaws clamp tight.  The man SCREAMS and buckles.

A fifth man dives at Lee, but he staggers, grabbing the man and shoving 
him headfirst into a ROW OF HANGING POTS. HEAD SMACKING into each one.

A sixth man hits Carter from behind.  Carter spins around, punches the 
man, knocking him into the hot stove, his hands going down ONTO THE HOT 
GRIDDLE.  The man screams and turns quickly at Carter who nails him 
with a huge soup ladle.

Lee turns, slipping, but kicking behind, catching another man and 
sending him crashing into a sink - pile of DIRTY DISHES CASCADING DOWN 
ON TOP OF HIM.

Lee swings wildly.  Another man ducks, comes back up, pulling a gun, 
but Lee is still spinning uncontrollably and hits the man the second 
time around.  The gun flies out of his hand and clanks onto the stove - 
open flame heating the metal.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - FANG SHAN RESTAURANT -- CONTINUOUS

The FBI now in position.  Watching the restaurant. People coming out in 
a panic.  And among them - Sang.  He blends into the crowd and moves 
down the street.

INT. AMBASSADOR'S JAGUAR -- CONTINUOUS

Han, Russ, Whitney are watching.

WHITNEY 
Something's not right.

Russ checks his watch.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

Lee slips, grabbing hold of a refrigerator door to keep from falling.  
Pulling it open.  Door slamming into the head of number seven, face 
first.  Then Lee grabs a tray full of knives, slips backward, 
accidentally flinging them over his head, back at them.

Everyone hits the floor as the KNIVES impale the wall.

But one man manages to throw a bottle at Carter.  Carter ducks and the 
bottle crashes into the stove.  FLAMES ERUPT as the OIL falls onto the 
gas flames.

The oil soaked wall BURSTS INTO FLAME.  And the OVERHEATED BULLETS in 
the gun on the stove start to EXPLODE.

Carter kicks open the back door as THE KITCHEN starts to FILL WITH 
BLACK OILY SMOKE.

EXT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

Carter and Lee jump into the alley as the KITCHEN IGNITES.  GAS MAIN 
BLOWING.  WINDOWS SHATTER.  FLAMES BLOW INTO THE ALLEY. Lee and Carter 
are knocked down.

And they get up slowly.  Both are covered in kitchen crap.  Food, oil, 
dirt.  Now, they move quickly down the alley.

Then Carter sees his GUN on the ground.  He picks it up.

CARTER 
Oh man, I don't even wanna know how it 
got out here!

Lee staggers.  Carter grabs him.

A POLICE CAR roars up in front of them.  POLICE are out, guns drawn, 
pointing at Carter and Lee.

POLICE OFFICER 
Drop the gun!

CARTER 
I'm L.A.P.D.

SECOND POLICE OFFICER 
Drop the gun now!

CARTER 
(reaching for his pocket)
I've got my i.d.

POLICE OFFICER 
No!

The police crouch, GUNS POINTED AT CARTER.  Carter freezes, hand in 
pocket.  Then Carter realizes he doesn't have it.

CARTER 
No, wait.  I don't have it.
(to Lee)
You have it.

LEE 
Oh yes.

Lee, staggering, reaches for his pocket.  The Police IMMEDIATELY TURN 
their guns on Lee.

SECOND POLICE OFFICER 
Nobody move!

But Lee suddenly realizes --

LEE 
Oh no, I dropped it.

CARTER 
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?

LEE 
I'm sorry.

POLICE OFFICER 
You lent him your i.d.?

Lee is completely leaning against Carter to keep from falling over.  
Carter hangs on, leaning back against him.

CARTER 
(angry)
Yeah, I lent him my i.d.  You got a 
problem with that?

SECOND POLICE OFFICER 
No, I can see the resemblance. GET 
YOUR HANDS ON TOP OF YOUR HEADS!

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE -- DAY

THREE FEDERAL UNMARKED CARS screech to a stop in front. Doors open.  
Lee and Carter are escorted by a BEVY OF FBI AGENTS.

Both Lee and Carter are still covered with the mess from the kitchen 
fight.  Carter still partially carries Lee.

CARTER
(to Lee)
Don't worry. We're gonna make a full 
report.  Bring these boys up to date.  

Carter looks confidently at the bureau boys surrounding him.  They all 
look straight ahead, no expression, no comment.

INT. CHINESE CONSULATE - HAN'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Carter is split off from Lee by the AGENTS.  Carter is lead into the 
office.  Lee is escorted up the stairs.

CARTER 
Hey, wait a minute, he's with me.

AGENT 
Shut up.

They push Carter into the office.  Pulling the door shut. Lee is lead 
across the room.

INT. HAN'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Russ is seated behind the desk, on the phone.

RUSS
... yes, he's here.  Uh-huh... 
Absolutely.

Russ hangs up, stands to face Carter.

CARTER 
Okay, let me start from the top.  A 
few days ago I was on this munitions 
dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after 
the shit blew up last night...

RUSS 
(interrupting)
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no 
longer on this assignment. 

CARTER
What?!

RUSS
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way 
back to China.  Now, get out. Before I 
file obstruction of justice charges 
against you. 

Carter is stunned. TWO AGENTS open the door behind him. Carter 
hesitates.  He's angry.  But this is not the time or the place.  He 
exits.

INT. ANOTHER ROOM - CHINESE CONSULATE -- DAY

Han is pacing.  Lee is leaning against a wall to keep from falling 
over.  Ashamed.  Conversation in MANDARIN.

LEE 
I have disappointed you.

HAN 
My disappointment is not what matters.

Lee tries to take a step toward Han, but his knees start to get weak 
and he leans back against the wall.

Han turns away from Lee.  He can't stand to look at him in his 
³condition².

HAN 
I have no say in it now.  I must rely 
upon the FBI to get Soon-Young back.  
They will escort you to the airport.

LEE 
It was Juntao.

Han turns.

HAN 
Juntao?

Lee nods.  The door suddenly opens and Carter enters with TWO AGENTS 
trying to keep him from doing so.  Carter pulls away from them.

CARTER 
Mr. Ambassador, I just want you to 
know that whatever you think Lee did, 
he didn't.  It was my fault.

AGENT 
(to Han)
Sorry, sir.

Carter straightens out his dirty coat.  Trying to find some dignity in 
his filthy appearance.

CARTER 
I never intended to risk your 
daughter's life...

The PHONE RINGS.

Russ and three agents enter quickly.

RUSS 
We've got a call.
(to agents)
Get them out!

The Agents move to Lee and Carter.  Escorting them out of the room.  
The door closes.

RUSS 
Okay, pick it up.

Han picks up a phone at the same time Russ picks up a second phone.  
Russ listens in.

HAN 
(into phone)
Yes.

SANG'S VOICE 
You have run out of time.  The amount 
now is two hundred million.  I will 
call later with instructions.  You 
will either deliver the money or pick 
up the body of your daughter.

HAN 
Please, you must understand, what 
happened today was not --

SOON YOUNG'S VOICE 
Dad, are you okay?

HAN 
(stunned)
Soon Young!

INT. VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Sang is holding the phone to Soon Young.  The black mask has been 
pulled up so she can talk.

SOON YOUNG 
Please, do what they ask or they will 
kill me.

BACK TO HAN

HAN 
Soon Young, tell them I will do --

The phone goes dead.  End of conversation.  Han looks at Russ, then 
turns away, trying to maintain his composure.

CUT TO:

EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE -- CONTINUOUS

Lee and Carter are waiting outside the consulate.  Agents flanking 
them.  CARS are driving in through the gates.

CARTER 
I'm sorry, Lee.

LEE 
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no 
chance now.

The first car pulls up.  Agents opens the back door. Lee gets in.  Car 
pulls away.

Second car pulls up.  It's Carter's Cadillac.  Agent gets out, leaves 
the car running.  Waits by the door.

CARTER 
Nice job.

Carter hands a DOLLAR to the Agent as he gets into the car.  He tears 
out of the drive as the Agent crumples the bill and throws it after 
him.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. CHINESE CONSULATE -- CONTINUOUS

Russ, Han, Whitney.  Han is seated, head in hands.

Whitney gets a call over his radio ear phone.

WHITNEY 
Excuse me, sir.  Mr. Griffin has 
arrived.

Han looks up.  Russ nods to Whitney, who crosses to the door, opens it.

Han's face brightens when he sees GRIFFIN.  Griffin smiles.  New hope 
has arrived.

GRIFFIN 
I'm sorry, my friend.  I could not sit 
back and do nothing.

Griffin bows to Han.

A SEDAN moves past in traffic.

INT. SEDAN -- CONTINUOUS

Evans is behind the wheel.  Monroe next to him.  Lee is in the back

READS: LAX.

Lee is feeling very much alone.

INT. CARTER'S CADILLAC-- CONTINUOUS

He changes lanes as he follows Lee's car off the freeway. He dials his 
cell phone one handed.

CARTER
(on the phone)
Don't hang up. Please.

INTERCUT

With Johnson at home. She just got out of the SHOWER.

JOHNSON
You got a lot of guts calling me.

CARTER
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and 
you, Johnson. There's no one else I 
can trust.

JOHNSON
You made a fool out of me! In front of 
the FBI!

CARTER
Listen, this ain't about us! It's 
about a thirteen year old girl. She's 
not gonna make it. Unless we do 
something. 

That works on Johnson. 

JOHNSON
Jesus...what do you want?

CARTER
This whole thing is goin' down 
tonight. I need to know where the 
Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will 
be keepin' a lid on everything. You 
thing you can do that?

JOHNSON
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find 
Œem.

CARTER
Alright, Johnson, thank you.

So...what are you wearing?

Evans and Monroe exit the plane.

Lee is sitting in First Class.  Staring out the window. Completely 
depressed.  Going home in disgrace.

INT. TERMINAL -- CONTINUOUS

Evans and Monroe turn from the window and start walking away from the 
gate.

We stay with what WOULD HAVE BEEN their POV of the 747. After a beat, a 
FOOD CART rises up to the 747 door. Carter is leaning against the cart, 
enjoying the ride.

INT. 747 -- CONTINUOUS

Everyone seated.  Lee sits quietly.  Lee looks up. Carter is standing 
at his seat.

We HEAR the plane door close in preparation for taxi.

LEE 
What are you doing here?

CARTER
Well, I ain't goin' to China.
(whispering)
And neither are you.

Carter moves up the aisle to a FLIGHT ATTENDANT. He takes a 
handkerchief out of his pocket and puts it over his face.

CARTER (cont'd)
Excuse me. I'm declaring a medical 
emergency.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
What? Are you sick?

CARTER 
No, no, not me.
(points at Lee)
My patient.

Lee HEARS that he's the sick man. 

CARTER 
I am Doctor...Dwight Gooden.  Center 
for Disease Control. And I have to get 
him off this airplane. Now.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
What's wrong with him?

Lee looks at Carter.  He'd like to know what's wrong with him too.

Carter WHISPERS VERY LOUDLY so the whole first class compartment can 
hear.

CARTER 
He escaped from our clinic. He's got 
the Eboola...Moola virus. Very deadly. 
It's transmitted by the breath.

A collective GASP goes up from the first class passengers.

CARTER (cont'd)
Especially bad breath.

Lee immediately starts MOANING. Carter suddenly goes into FAKE CHINESE, 
directed at Lee.

Lee looks at him for a beat and then ANSWERS IN REAL MANDARIN.

CARTER
Oh God, we're in trouble. He's already 
started the chills...

Lee starts SHAKING like he has a fever.

CARTER (cont'd)
And diarrhea.

Lee looks at him like, ³how am I supposed to do that?²

CARTER (cont'd)
I mean gas?

Lee looks over at a middle aged woman, and COUGHS at her. The woman 
SCREAMS.

CARTER (cont'd)
Open the door!

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
I can't open the door! We're ready to 
taxi.

CARTER 
Open the door now!

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
But I --

Lee turns to a BANK PRESIDENT sitting next to him. He coughs at him. 
The guy SCREAMS and covers his face with his WALL STREET JOURNAL.

Carter pulls Lee out of the seat.

CARTER 
Open the door, open the door!

Carter goes into another burst of FAKE CHINESE.

Lee HOWLS and MOANS.

CARTER
Hurry!  The projectile vomiting is 
about to begin!

The Flight Attendant rushes to the door, opens it.

And Lee runs for it, continuing to HOWL with Carter clinging to him.

CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE CONSULATE - HAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

Russ, Han, Whitney and other Agents.  Griffin has the floor.

GRIFFIN 
For fifteen years, Juntao has been the 
most powerful crime lord in southeast 
Asia, until the Chinese government 
regained control of Hong Kong.  The 
British Government tried to bring down 
his operation, but failed.

RUSS 
But why the Ambassador's daughter?

HAN 
One of the last efforts between the 
British and the Chinese Governments 
was to raid every known asset of 
Juntao's operation.  We confiscated 
over five hundred million dollars in 
weapons, drugs and a collection of 
Chinese art unsurpassed in the world.

GRIFFIN
But Juntao disappeared once again.  
Without witnesses.

WHITNEY 
Will he kill the girl?

GRIFFIN 
I don't know.  According to our 
informant, Juntao is seeking 
restitution.  My advise is... pay the 
money. 

CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE CONSULATE - HAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Take the money with you tonight. Pack 
it in six dragons. You will be

gown. She looks gorgeous.

CARTER
Oh my god...what happened to you?

JOHNSON 
It's called a dress.

CARTER 
It's called you're gonna kill me.  
What're you doin' with that on?

Johnson crosses the room.  Picks up TWO TUXEDOS hanging on a door.

JOHNSON 
The Ambassador is hosting the closing 
night of Chinese Expo at the 
Convention Center. It's black tie.

Carter is trying not to look at Johnson's cleavage.

CARTER
Well...OK. Good job.

Johnson hands one tux to Carter, the other to Lee.

JOHNSON
(to Lee)
I'm Johnson. I had to guess at your 
size.

LEE 
Thank you. You look very beautiful.

Johnson smiles.

CARTER

Hey, stop that. We're workin' here! I 
can't believe you be talkin' that

Johnson stops dead when she sees the car.

JOHNSON
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.

JOHNSON
Yeah, if you're Superfly.

CARTER
That's it! You can attack me, but when 
you attack my car, I cannot forgive! 
You in the back, girl!

Lee gallantly opens the door for Johnson who reluctantly gets in the 
back seat. Lee starts to get back there with her.

Where the hell are you goin'?!

Lee gets up front.

- CHINESE EXPO.

INT.SOUTH HALL (CONVENTION CENTER) -- CONTINUOUS

Escalators move down to a huge room filled with art of all kinds, 
including huge sculptures, Chinese screens, glass and ceramic vases in 
large DISPLAY CASES. In fact, we may recognize some of the art from the 
opening bust in Hong Kong.

Dominating the center of the room is a LARGE BUDDHA standing on the 
edge of a HUGE POOL filled with water.

A REFRESHMENT STAND is doing brisk business.

We see Ambassador Han and his wife circulating, shaking hands, talking.  
Trying their best not to show their tension and fear.

Griffin is with them.  Glass of wine in hand.  Shaking hands and 
chatting.

Whitney moves through the crowd of people.  Keeping watch on Han.  He 
glances across the room at Monroe.  Monroe is also alert.  But they are 
both in tuxes.  And unless you knew they were FBI, you couldn't tell.

INT. FBI SURVEILLANCE VAN -- NIGHT

AGENTS monitor the event with video monitors and listening devices.

We see it's Sang.

Griffin glances at TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS.  Shu and Chung.

A SOCIALITE crosses to him.

SOCIALITE 
The exhibit is extraordinary, Mr. 
Ambassador.  I hope this is just the 
beginning of more cultural exchanges 
between our two countries.

Han forces a smile.

INT. SOUTH LOBBY

Carter, Lee and Johnson come down the escalator into the hall.

ON WHITNEY

He gets some disturbing news over his ear phone.

WHITNEY

How the hell did they get here?

Whitney turns quickly, scanning the crowd.  But the place is packed.  
Black ties and gowns everywhere.

ON CARTER, JOHNSON, LEE

They're walking past the exhibits.

LEE 
Oh no.

CARTER 
What?

LEE 
The art.

JOHNSON 
(to Lee)
You don't like it?

CARTER
It's okay. For restaurants. 

LEE 
No, it is China, my country, my 
history.  If any of it gets damaged...

CARTER 
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna 
happen to it.

Carter turns and sees Griffin through the crowd.

CARTER 
Wait. That guy. I saw him outside the 
restaurant.

Carter points through the crowd at Griffin. Lee is shocked.

LEE 
Oh my god. Griffin.

CARTER 
You know him?

But Lee is already moving toward Griffin.

ON GRIFFIN

He's talking with someone when he happens to catch Lee moving towards 
him. He never loses his smile. Until he sees Lee mouth the word:

LEE
Juntao.

Griffin looks around and sees Carter moving in from another direction.

Griffin quickly excuses himself and heads for the escalator.

ON WHITNEY

He spots Carter and Johnson moving towards the escalator as they follow 
Griffin.

WHITNEY
(into RADIO)
Wait. I see Carter. Request assistance 
immediately.

Suddenly, Johnson appears at Whitney's side. She flashes her LAPD badge 
and says:

JOHNSON
I got to talk to you. Now.

ON GRIFFIN

He moves to a PODIUM WITH A MICROPHONE that overlooks the room below.

GRIFFIN
Ladies and Gentlemen, can I have your 
attention please?

The crowd hushes.

GRIFFIN (cont'd)
Welcome to Chinese Expo. The exhibit 
you see before you represents over a 
thousand years of Chinese art. Up 
until several months ago, most of this 
exhibit was in the hands of one 
private collector.
(pause)
Me. So, I should say more correctly, 
welcome to my exhibit. 

ON HAN

He looks up with a puzzled expression at his friend.

ON WHITNEY

He looks up at Griffin too as Johnson keeps filling him in.

GRIFFIN (cont'd)
Great collectors are born, not made. 
It took most of my life to find and 
catalog the priceless pieces you see. 
And then, in one fell swoop, they were 
taken from me. But tonight, I will be 
paid in full.

Griffin holds up a DETONATOR.

GRIFFIN (cont'd)
A bomb is wired to Ambassador Han's 
daughter in a car outside. 

AUDIBLE GASPS from the floor.

Carter immediately ducks down in the crowd and runs bent over for the 
exit.

ON WHITNEY

He turns to his lapel mike. It's immediately ripped off his collar by 
Sang.

Other agents on the floor are quickly stopped from communicating by 
Griffin's men.

GRIFFIN (cont'd)
No one moves!

Lee stares up at Griffin trying to figure out what to do.

GRIFFIN (cont'd)
She will die if I push this button. 
But if you are all patient, my 
transportation will be here shortly 
and you can continue to enjoy my 
collection. Everyone just stay calm. 
(to Han)
You just picked on the wrong guy, my 
friend.

Shu turns quickly at the sound of the voice.  Suddenly 
facing Carter who has his gun out, pointed at him.

CARTER 
It's not red now, but you try 
anything, and it's gonna be blood red. 

Carter moves up to him, keeping the gun leveled.

CARTER 
Only one problem.  I forgot my cuffs.

He grabs Shu's head and slams it into the side of the van.  Shu drops.  
Out cold.

Carter pulls keys from Shu's pocket.

CARTER 
You have the right to remain silent 
alllll night.

Carter moves to the back of the van.  Looks at the LICENSE.  
CALIFORNIA.  LIK.

Unlocks the back door.  Stands back, ready to shoot, as he opens the 
door.  Looks in.

ON SOON YOUNG

She's in the back of the van.  Black hood over her face. She's wearing 
a BULKY VEST that is covered with plastic explosive.

Carter pulls the hood off.

CARTER
Hi. Detective Carter, LAPD. Let's get 
this thing off you.

SOON YOUNG
(near tears)
NO! Don't touch it! I heard them say 
it will explode.

Carter hesitates.

CUT TO:

INT.CONVENTION CENTER

Griffin stands at the podium, still holding the detonator high so 
everyone can see it.

He speaks quietly into his lapel mike.

GRIFFIN
Where are you?

INT. HELICOPTER-NIGHT

The pilot keys his mike.

PILOT
Three minutes.

INT.CONVENTION CENTER

Griffin nods to Sang down on the floor. Sang starts moving up the 
escalator.

GRIFFIN
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We'll 
be calling this an evening.

Suddenly we HEAR a CLATTER AND RUMBLE.  Low at first, but building 
LOUDER and LOUDER.  Everyone turns.

THROUGH THE PLATE GLASS WINDOW we can SEE THE VAN tearing up the museum 
steps.  Right toward the window.

And it's not stopping.

ON THE VAN

It crashes RIGHT INTO THE WINDOW.  Everyone scatters. The Van roars 
into the hall. It knocks over a huge DISPLAY CASE scattering glass 
everywhere. Finally, it RAMS the refreshment booth and stops in the 
middle of the room.

The BACK DOORS OPEN and Carter steps out with Soon Young who is still 
wearing the bomb.

CARTER 
(to Griffin)
Okay, asshole, here's your bomb.  You 
wanna blow somebody up, go ahead.  
Push the button.  Let's blow everybody 
up.

Everyone who didn't panic before, does now. People start running.

HAN 
Soon Young!

An FBI AGENT grabs Han and his wife and pushes them down on the floor.

Lee and Johnson run to Soon Young's side.

ON GRIFFIN

For the first time, he looks scared. He turns away from the podium and 
runs.

Sang turns on the escalator, pulls a MAC 10 and sprays the room.

FBI agents on the floor take cover behind the priceless art work, pull 
guns and start firing.

Griffin's men return fire as the last of the black tie crowd hit the 
deck.

Johnson grabs Soon Young and ducks back in the van with Lee.

Carter fires several times as he follows them.

CUT TO:

INT. THE SECOND FLOOR ROOM

The last of the money is being loaded from one remaining suitcase and 
put into the dragons by two agents.  Russ watches.

Suddenly, Griffin runs into the room and opens fire with a nine 
millimeter.

He hits the two agents doing the packing. Russ, totally taken by 
surprise, reaches for his weapon, but Russ cuts him down.

Griffin grabs the last full suitcase and runs out.

CUT TO:

INT. THE VAN

Johnson is studying the bomb. Soon Young continues to whimper.

JOHNSON
(to Soon Young)
It's gonna be OK.

The battle RAGES outside. Occasionally, the van is hit by gun fire.

CARTER
Can you get it off?

Johnson doesn't answer. Instead, she pulls a SWISS ARMY KNIFE out of 
her dainty purse, flips out the tiny scissors and cuts TWO WIRES 
leading to one of the CLASPS on the vest.

JOHNSON
OK.

Lee helps her take the vest off. Johnson hands it to Lee.

JOHNSON (cont'd)
Get rid of it. The detonator can still 
set it off. And this...

She points to a SWITCH on the front of the vest. 

JOHNSON (cont'd)
Don't touch. It's a back up. Short 
fuse. Five...maybe ten seconds.

CARTER
I'll cover you.

At that moment, the van is hit hard with automatic fire. Johnson throws 
herself over Soon Young as Carter and Lee dive out the back door.

INT.THE HALL

Carter and Lee jump behind the Buddha. Gunfire erupts from all 
quarters.

CARTER
(to Lee)
Go! 

Lee takes off for the escalator. He runs half way up when Russ appears 
at the top. He's bleeding badly and staggering.

RUSS
(to Lee)
Griffin...the elevator.

Russ collapses. Lee looks up. A hundred and fifty feet above him, we 
see a catwalk below the skylights that make up the roof.  The catwalk 
leads to AN OPEN ROOF DOOR.

Lee scans the ceiling and spots an ENCLOSED LADDER that leads all the 
way up to the catwalk. He takes off.

CUT TO:

INT. AN ELEVATOR

Griffin keys his mike.

GRIFFIN
(into radio)
Plan B. Meet me on the roof.

INT. THE HELICOPTER

The pilot is just getting ready to set the chopper down in the parking 
lot. He aborts and pulls full power.

The chopper starts to rise.

INT. THE HALL

Lee reaches the ladder, PUTS THE BOMB JACKET ON and starts climbing.

ON CARTER

He runs up the escalator and bends down to Russ. He's alive but hurt 
bad. Carter turns and sees SANG running and firing BELOW HIM.

Carter leaps off the escalator and lands on Sang.

INT. THE ELEVATOR

Griffin looks down at the detonator in his hand. For a second he looks 
like he's going to push the button. But he hesitates.

INT. THE LADDER

Lee is flying up it at superhuman speed. When the inside ladder proves 
too slow, he switches to the outside GUARD CAGE and climbs that.

ON SANG AND CARTER

Sang is kicking the shit out of Carter. Carter gets in one punch and 
Sang hits him three times and sweeps his feet out from under him.

EXT. THE ELEVATOR

The doors open and Griffin walks out onto the catwalk that runs just 
below the ceiling. He looks down.

GRIFFIN'S POV

Below him, the battle still rages, but FBI agents are getting the upper 
hand.

Griffin holds up the detonator. His thumb covers the button.

LEE'S VOICE
Looking for this?

Griffin looks up and sees Lee, breathing hard, on the other side of the 
catwalk. He's pointing to the bomb that he's wearing.

Griffin fires two shots at Lee that ricochet off the catwalk railing. 
Lee hits the floor of the catwalk.

INT. THE HALL

Two of Griffin's men are cut down by Whitney as they try to escape up 
the escalator.

ON SANG AND CARTER

Sang KICKS Carter in the face and he goes down. Sang practically 
stumbles over Carter's gun and picks it up. Carter staggers to his 
feet.

Sang points the gun at Carter and cocks it.

CARTER
That's my gun, mother fucker.

Carter's hands fly, doing Lee's routine. Suddenly, the gun ends up in 
Carter's hands.

Sang leaps for the gun. Carter drills him in the forehead.

INT. THE CATWALK

Griffin fires at Lee as he tries to make his way around to the roof 
door. Lee CRAWLS. Suddenly, a ROAR starts a second before we see the 
CHOPPER rise into a hover.

Griffin runs around the catwalk for the door.

Lee looks up and sees a ROPE AND PULLEY hanging over the abyss. He 
leaps for the railing and dives out into space.

He catches the rope and starts riding it to the other side of the 
catwalk.

Griffin sees him coming and fires on the run. He misses. Clicks. The 
gun is empty.  He throws his gun and hits Lee in the HEAD with it. Lee 
almost falls and then:

WHAM! Lee runs right into Griffin. They crumple on the catwalk.

INT.THE HALL

Things are under the control of the FBI.

Carter is holstering his gun when he hears Griffin's shot. And then a 
second later, the gun smashes into the marble floor.

He looks up and sees them fighting on the catwalk.

INT. THE CATWALK

Griffin tries to push a groggy Lee off him but he won't let go of his 
legs. Griffin starts beating Lee over the head with the suitcase. It 
POPS open and ten million dollars flutters out like confetti.

Lee pushes through the money, stands up and grabs Griffin. Griffin 
tries to get away and HITS THE SWITCH ON THE JACKET.

They both stop and look at each other in panic. Then Griffin HEAD BUTTS 
Lee. Lee starts to go down, but instead, he HEAD BUTTS Griffin back. 
Griffin crumples.

Lee holds him, wriggles out of the vest and PUTS IT ON GRIFFIN. Then he 
looks down, tips them both over the railing and THEY FALL.

WHACK! Lee grabs THE BOTTOM OF THE CATWALK as he goes by. 
Unfortunately, Griffin woke up and is holding onto Lee's foot. Lee 
kicks once. Twice. The third is a charm.

Griffin falls backwards toward THE BUDDHA POOL. He falls and falls, all 
the while looking back up at Lee.  He hits with a huge splash.

CLOSE ON

Griffin's face under water. He's still alive. KABOOM!

INT. THE HALL

A SHOWER OF WATER falls over the hall. Everybody gets wet.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MUSEUM -- LATER

The FBI is escorting the bad guys out of the building. Sang is escorted 
out by the CORONER.  Han approaches Lee. Extends his hand.

HAN 
I owe you everything.

LEE
Only your friendship.

Lee looks around at all the BROKEN ART.

LEE (cont'd)
It is so sad. So much beauty ruined. 
So much of our culture gone.

HAN
Yes. But...
(pointing)
Life goes on.

He's pointing to Soon Young who is in the arms of her mother. Lee 
smiles.

ON CARTER

He's standing next to Whitney at the top of the escalator. Both Carter 
and Whitney are SOAKING WET from the water explosion.

Whitney is just hanging up a cellular.

WHITNEY
(to Carter)
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a 
bitch.

CARTER
Tell me about it.

WHITNEY
He was just doing his job.

CARTER
So was I.

LEE VO
And me too.

Lee is standing behind Whitney. Whitney looks a little embarrassed now.

WHITNEY
(mumbling)
And the FBI appreciates it.

Whitney walks away.

CARTER
Prick.

Carter looks at Lee and points up to the ladder that leads to the 
catwalk.

CARTER (cont'd)
You got circus blood in you?

LEE
Shortcut.

Carter laughs and looks down the escalator.

ON JOHNSON

She's sitting on the last step. She's SOAKING WET too. Her hair and 
dress are ruined. She looks depressed.

Carter walks down to her.

CARTER
You OK?

JOHNSON
We saved the girl and got the bad 
guys, didn't we?

CARTER
Yeah. So why you look do down?

JOHNSON
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look 
like shit.

CARTER
Not to me. Never to me.

Johnson stares at him for a long beat.

JOHNSON
How about a lift home?

CARTER
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in 
the front seat.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. 747 -- NIGHT

Lee is seated, eyes closed, listening to MUSIC over his headphones.  
Carter walks down the aisle and takes the seat next to him.

CARTER 
Yo, what's up?

Lee opens his eyes.  Smiles.

LEE 
What a surprise!

CARTER 
FBI calls up my ass, says they need 
help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to 
drop everything.

LEE 
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country 
asked for the best.  I told them that 
was you.  Now I will show you around 
my Œhood.  

CARTER
No shark fin, no camel hump.
(re: CD player)
What you listenin' to?

LEE 
Oh, I think you like this very much.

Carter puts on the head phones.  We HEAR the first few bars of HELP ME 
RHONDA.  Carter's face freezes.

THE 747 -- CONTINUOUS

glides toward Hong Kong to the All-American music of the Beach Boys.
